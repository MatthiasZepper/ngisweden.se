The presumed genetic targets of many regions of aUPD remain unknown. Here we describe the association of chromosome 22 aUPD with mutations that delete the C-terminus of PRR14L in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), related myeloid neoplasms and age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH). Myeloid panel analysis identified a median of three additional mutated genes (range 1-6) in cases with a myeloid neoplasm (n\u2009=\u20098), but no additional mutations in cases with ARCH (n\u2009=\u20092) suggesting that mutated PRR14L alone may be sufficient to drive clonality. PRR14L has very limited homology to other proteins and its function is unknown. ShRNA knockdown of PRR14L in human CD34+ cells followed by in vitro growth and differentiation assays showed an increase in monocytes and decrease in neutrophils, decrease in neutrophils, consistent with a CMML-like phenotype. RNA-Seq and cellular localization studies suggest a role for PRR14L in cell division. PRR14L is thus a novel, biallelically mutated gene and potential founding abnormality in myeloid neoplasms.","doi":"10.1038\/s41375-018-0340-5","pmid":"30573780","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"10.1038\/s41375-018-0340-5"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-07T15:14:46.197Z","modified":"2019-01-07T15:14:46.207Z","is_collab":false},"1":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"1f920fd4f19a40ecb0f0ef5a1e7959f6","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/1f920fd4f19a40ecb0f0ef5a1e7959f6.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/1f920fd4f19a40ecb0f0ef5a1e7959f6"}},"title":"Historical Genomes Reveal the Genomic Consequences of Recent Population Decline in Eastern Gorillas.","authors":[{"family":"van der Valk","given":"Tom","initials":"T"},{"family":"D\u00edez-Del-Molino","given":"David","initials":"D"},{"family":"Marques-Bonet","given":"Tomas","initials":"T"},{"family":"Guschanski","given":"Katerina","initials":"K"},{"family":"Dal\u00e9n","given":"Love","initials":"L"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-12-18","journal":{"volume":null,"issn":"1879-0445","issue":null,"title":"Curr.

Here, we use whole genomes recovered from century-old historical museum specimens to quantify the genomic consequences of small population size in the critically endangered Grauer's and endangered mountain gorillas. We find a reduction of genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding and genetic load in the Grauer's gorilla, which experienced severe population declines in recent decades. In contrast, the small but relatively stable mountain gorilla population has experienced little genomic change during the last century. These results suggest that species histories as well as the rate of demographic change may influence how population declines affect genome diversity.","doi":"10.1016\/j.cub.2018.11.055","pmid":"30595519","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"S0960-9822(18)31554-9"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-07T15:14:46.864Z","modified":"2019-01-07T15:14:46.874Z","is_collab":false},"2":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"9363446f0fb74636b399f76c2a069f9b","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/9363446f0fb74636b399f76c2a069f9b.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/9363446f0fb74636b399f76c2a069f9b"}},"title":"Somatic Structural Alterations in Childhood Leukemia Can Be Backtracked in Neonatal Dried Blood Spots by Use of Whole-Genome Sequencing and Digital PCR.","authors":[{"family":"Taylan","given":"Fulya","initials":"F"},{"family":"Bang","given":"Benedicte","initials":"B"},{"family":"\u00d6fverholm","given":"Ingegerd Ivanov","initials":"II"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Anh-Nhi","initials":"AN"},{"family":"Heyman","given":"Mats","initials":"M"},{"family":"Barbany","given":"Gisela","initials":"G"},{"family":"Zachariadis","given":"Vasilios","initials":"V"},{"family":"Nordgren","given":"Ann","initials":"A"}],"type":"letter","published":"2018-12-05","journal":{"volume":null,"issn":"1530-8561","issue":null,"title":"Clin.

If released untreated, these sulfur compounds can be oxidized to generate highly acidic wastewaters [termed 'acid mine drainage (AMD)'] that cause severe environmental pollution. One potential method to remediate mining wastewaters is the maturing biotechnology of 'microbial fuel cells' that offers the sustainable removal of acid generating inorganic sulfur compounds alongside producing an electrical current. Microbial fuel cells exploit the ability of bacterial cells to transfer electrons to a mineral as the terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration by replacing the mineral with a solid anode. In consequence, by substituting natural minerals with electrodes, microbial fuel cells also provide an excellent platform to understand environmental microbe-mineral interactions that are fundamental to element cycling. Previously, tetrathionate degradation coupled to the generation of an electrical current has been demonstrated and here we report a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbial community. Reconstruction of inorganic sulfur compound metabolism suggested the substrate tetrathionate was metabolized by the \n            Ferroplasma-like and Acidithiobacillus-like populations via multiple pathways. Characterized Ferroplasma species do not utilize inorganic sulfur compounds, suggesting a novel Ferroplasma-like population had been selected. Oxidation of intermediate sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and adenylyl-sulfate released electrons and the extracellular electron transfer to the anode was suggested to be dominated by candidate soluble electron shuttles produced by the Ferroplasma-like population. However, as the soluble electron shuttle compounds also have alternative functions within the cell, it cannot be ruled out that acidophiles use novel, uncharacterized mechanisms to mediate extracellular electron transfer. Several populations within the community were suggested to metabolize intermediate inorganic sulfur compounds by multiple pathways, which highlights the potential for mutualistic or symbiotic relationships. This study provided the genetic base for acidophilic microbial fuel cells utilized for the remediation of inorganic sulfur compounds from AMD.","doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2018.02945","pmid":"30568637","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6289977"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-07T15:14:47.522Z","modified":"2019-01-07T15:14:47.532Z","is_collab":false},"4":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"2cbe3cb13de242308430d8bb2440ff5b","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/2cbe3cb13de242308430d8bb2440ff5b.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/2cbe3cb13de242308430d8bb2440ff5b"}},"title":"A major locus controls local adaptation and adaptive life history variation in a perennial plant","authors":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jing","initials":"J"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Jihua","initials":"J"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Biyue","initials":"B"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Kathryn M","initials":"KM"},{"family":"Michelson","given":"Ingrid H","initials":"IH"},{"family":"Johansson","given":"Anna","initials":"A"},{"family":"Nystedt","given":"Bj\u00f6rn","initials":"B"},{"family":"Scofield","given":"Douglas G","initials":"DG"},{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Ove","initials":"O"},{"family":"Jansson","given":"Stefan","initials":"S"},{"family":"Street","given":"Nathaniel R","initials":"NR"},{"family":"Ingvarsson","given":"P\u00e4r K","initials":"PK"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-12-00","journal":{"volume":"19","issn":"1474-760X","issue":"1","pages":null,"title":"Genome Biol."},"abstract":"The initiation of growth cessation and dormancy represent critical life-history trade-offs between survival and growth and have important fitness effects in perennial plants. Such adaptive life-history traits often show strong local adaptation along environmental gradients but, despite their importance, the genetic architecture of these traits remains poorly understood.\n\nWe integrate whole genome re-sequencing with environmental and phenotypic data from common garden experiments to investigate the genomic basis of local adaptation across a latitudinal gradient in European aspen (Populus tremula). A single genomic region containing the PtFT2 gene mediates local adaptation in the timing of bud set and explains 65% of the observed genetic variation in bud set. This locus is the likely target of a recent selective sweep that originated right before or during colonization of northern Scandinavia following the last glaciation. Field and greenhouse experiments confirm that variation in PtFT2 gene expression affects the phenotypic variation in bud set that we observe in wild natural populations.\n\nOur results reveal a major effect locus that determines the timing of bud set and that has facilitated rapid adaptation to shorter growing seasons and colder climates in European aspen. The discovery of a single locus explaining a substantial fraction of the variation in a key life-history trait is remarkable, given that such traits are generally considered to be highly polygenic. These findings provide a dramatic illustration of how loci of large-effect for adaptive traits can arise and be maintained over large geographical scales in natural populations.","doi":"10.1186\/s13059-018-1444-y","pmid":"29866176","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","Bioinformatics Long-term Support WABI":"Collaborative","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"SRA","description":"Populus tremula Raw sequence reads","key":"PRJNA297202"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-06-04T13:44:31.229Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:57:05.639Z","is_collab":false},"5":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"791d6a9d1a0548cc8e8c542c88a7269c","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/791d6a9d1a0548cc8e8c542c88a7269c.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/791d6a9d1a0548cc8e8c542c88a7269c"}},"title":"Somatic mutagenesis in satellite cells associates with human skeletal muscle aging","authors":[{"family":"Franco","given":"Irene","initials":"I"},{"family":"Johansson","given":"Anna","initials":"A"},{"family":"Olsson","given":"Karl","initials":"K"},{"family":"Vrta\u010dnik","given":"Peter","initials":"P"},{"family":"Lundin","given":"P\u00e4r","initials":"P"},{"family":"Helgadottir","given":"Hafdis T","initials":"HT"},{"family":"Larsson","given":"Malin","initials":"M"},{"family":"Rev\u00eachon","given":"Gwladys","initials":"G"},{"family":"Bosia","given":"Carla","initials":"C"},{"family":"Pagnani","given":"Andrea","initials":"A"},{"family":"Provero","given":"Paolo","initials":"P"},{"family":"Gustafsson","given":"Thomas","initials":"T"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Helene","initials":"H"},{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Maria","initials":"M"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-12-00","journal":{"volume":"9","issn":"2041-1723","issue":"1","pages":null,"title":"Nat Commun"},"abstract":"Human aging is associated with a decline in skeletal muscle (SkM) function and a reduction in the number and activity of satellite cells (SCs), the resident stem cells.

We have used RNA-seq analysis to study the effects of APR-246 on gene expression in human breast cancer cell lines. Although the effect of APR-246 on gene expression was largely cell line dependent, six genes were upregulated across all three cell lines studied, i.e., TRIM16, SLC7A11, TXNRD1, SRXN1, LOC344887, and SLC7A11-AS1. We did not detect upregulation of canonical p53 target genes such as CDKN1A (p21), 14-3-3\u03c3, BBC3 (PUMA), and PMAIP1 (NOXA) by RNA-seq, but these genes were induced according to analysis by qPCR. Gene ontology analysis showed that APR-246 induced changes in pathways such as response to oxidative stress, gene expression, cell proliferation, response to nitrosative stress, and the glutathione biosynthesis process. Our results are consistent with the dual action of APR-246, i.e., reactivation of mutant p53 and modulation of redox activity.

Downstream analysis of the transcriptomics data identified several affected pathways including the 'fibrosis' and 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition' (EMT) pathway. Subsequently, functional validation studies were performed using AgNPs of two different sizes (10\u2009nm and 75\u2009nm). Both NPs increased collagen deposition, indicative of fibrosis, and induced EMT, as evidenced by an increased invasion index, anchorage independent cell growth, as well as cadherin switching. In conclusion, using a combination of RNA-Seq and functional assays, our study revealed that repeated low-dose, long-term exposure of human BEAS-2B cells to AgNPs is pro-fibrotic, induces EMT and cell transformation.","doi":"10.1038\/s41598-018-25085-5","pmid":"29703973","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure":"Collaborative","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"ArrayExpress","description":"RNA-Seq of BEAS-2B cells treated with low doses of Ag nanoparticles for 6 weeks","key":"E-MTAB-6321"},{"db":"ArrayExpress","description":"DNA methylation profiling of BEAS-2B cells exposed to low doses of Ag nanoparticles for 6 weeks","key":"E-MTAB-6331"}],"notes":"","qc":null,"created":"2018-05-03T10:11:16.742Z","modified":"2018-11-14T09:42:40.681Z","is_collab":false},"8":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"bf80a77c714149e6afd1d0a41d15178d","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/bf80a77c714149e6afd1d0a41d15178d.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/bf80a77c714149e6afd1d0a41d15178d"}},"title":"Spatially and functionally distinct subclasses of breast cancer-associated fibroblasts revealed by single cell RNA sequencing","authors":[{"family":"Bartoschek","given":"Michael","initials":"M"},{"family":"Oskolkov","given":"Nikolay","initials":"N"},{"family":"Bocci","given":"Matteo","initials":"M"},{"family":"L\u00f6vrot","given":"John","initials":"J"},{"family":"Larsson","given":"Christer","initials":"C"},{"family":"Sommarin","given":"Mikael","initials":"M"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Chris D","initials":"CD"},{"family":"Lindgren","given":"David","initials":"D"},{"family":"Pekar","given":"Gyula","initials":"G"},{"family":"Karlsson","given":"G\u00f6ran","initials":"G"},{"family":"Ringn\u00e9r","given":"Markus","initials":"M"},{"family":"Bergh","given":"Jonas","initials":"J"},{"family":"Bj\u00f6rklund","given":"\u00c5sa","initials":"\u00c5"},{"family":"Pietras","given":"Kristian","initials":"K"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-12-00","journal":{"volume":"9","issn":"2041-1723","issue":"1","pages":null,"title":"Nat Commun"},"abstract":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major constituent of the tumor microenvironment, although their origin and roles in shaping disease initiation, progression and treatment response remain unclear due to significant heterogeneity.

In this study, 21 boreholes representing a range of deep continental groundwaters from the \u00c4sp\u00f6 Hard Rock Laboratory were subjected to high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize how the different water types influence the microbial communities. Geochemical parameters showed the stability of the waters and allowed their classification into three groups. These were (i) waters influenced by infiltration from the Baltic Sea with a \"modern marine (MM)\" signature, (ii) a \"thoroughly mixed (TM)\" water containing groundwaters of several origins, and (iii) deep \"old saline (OS)\" waters. Decreasing microbial cell numbers positively correlated with depth. In addition, there was a stronger positive correlation between increased cell numbers and dissolved organic carbon for the MM compared to the OS waters. This supported that the MM waters depend on organic carbon infiltration from the Baltic Sea while the ancient saline waters were fed by \"geogases\" such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The 16S rRNA gene relative abundance of the studied groundwaters revealed different microbial community compositions. Interestingly, the TM water showed the highest dissimilarity compared to the other two water types, potentially due to the several contrasting water types contributing to this groundwater. The main identified microbial phyla in the groundwaters were Gammaproteobacteria, unclassified sequences, Campylobacterota (formerly Epsilonproteobacteria), Patescibacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria. Many of these taxa are suggested to mediate ferric iron and nitrate reduction, especially in the MM waters. This indicated that nitrate reduction may be a neglected but important process in the deep continental biosphere. In addition to the high number of unclassified sequences, almost 50% of the identified phyla were archaeal or bacterial candidate phyla. The percentage of unknown and candidate phyla increased with depth, pointing to the importance and necessity of further studies to characterize deep biosphere microbial populations.","doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2018.02880","pmid":"30538690","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6277548"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-07T15:14:48.233Z","modified":"2019-01-07T15:14:48.243Z","is_collab":false},"13":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"cc30831e3cc647858c35e963f1214907","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/cc30831e3cc647858c35e963f1214907.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/cc30831e3cc647858c35e963f1214907"}},"title":"Metatranscriptomes Reveal That All Three Domains of Life Are Active but Are Dominated by Bacteria in the Fennoscandian Crystalline Granitic Continental Deep Biosphere","authors":[{"family":"Lopez-Fernandez","given":"Margarita","initials":"M"},{"family":"Simone","given":"Domenico","initials":"D"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiaofen","initials":"X"},{"family":"Soler","given":"Lucile","initials":"L"},{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Emelie","initials":"E"},{"family":"Holmfeldt","given":"Karin","initials":"K"},{"family":"Lantz","given":"Henrik","initials":"H"},{"family":"Bertilsson","given":"Stefan","initials":"S"},{"family":"Dopson","given":"Mark","initials":"M"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-11-20","journal":{"volume":"9","issn":"2150-7511","issue":"6","pages":null,"title":"MBio"},"abstract":"The continental subsurface is suggested to contain a significant part of the earth's total biomass.

Therefore, microorganisms inhabiting this environment might profoundly influence the global nutrient and energy cycles. In this study, \n                in situ fixed RNA transcripts from two deep continental groundwaters from the \u00c4sp\u00f6 Hard Rock Laboratory (a Baltic Sea-influenced water with a residence time of <20\u2009years, defined as \"modern marine,\" and an \"old saline\" groundwater with a residence time of thousands of years) were subjected to metatranscriptome sequencing. Although small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene and mRNA transcripts aligned to all three domains of life, supporting activity within these community subsets, the data also suggested that the groundwaters were dominated by bacteria. Many of the SSU rRNA transcripts grouped within newly described candidate phyla or could not be mapped to known branches on the tree of life, suggesting that a large portion of the active biota in the deep biosphere remains unexplored. Despite the extremely oligotrophic conditions, mRNA transcripts revealed a diverse range of metabolic strategies that were carried out by multiple taxa in the modern marine water that is fed by organic carbon from the surface. In contrast, the carbon dioxide- and hydrogen-fed old saline water with a residence time of thousands of years predominantly showed the potential to carry out translation.

The findings highlight differences between organic carbon-fed shallow communities and carbon dioxide- and hydrogen-fed old saline waters.

Here we carried out two experiments with water from a eutrophic temperate fjord to examine whether low-oxygen microenvironments within particulate organic matter could be loci suitable for N2-fixation. First, water enriched with natural particles or sediment showed higher N2-fixation rates than bulk water, and nitrogenase genes (nifH) revealed that specific diazotrophs were affiliated with the particulate matter. Second, pristine artificial surfaces were rapidly colonized by diverse bacteria, while putative diazotrophs emerged relatively late (after 80 h) during the colonization, and phylotypes related to Pseudomonas and to anaerobic bacteria became dominant with time. Our study pinpoints natural particles as sites of N2-fixation, and indicates that resuspension of sediment material can elevate pelagic N2-fixation. Moreover, we show that diverse natural diazotrophs can colonize artificial surfaces, but colonization by \"pioneer\" bacterioplankton that more rapidly associate with surfaces appears to be a prerequisite. Whereas our experimental study supports the idea of pelagic particles as sites of N2-fixation by heterotrophic bacteria, future in situ studies are needed in order to establish identity, activity and ecology of particle associated NCDs as a function of individual particle characteristics.","doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2018.02759","pmid":"30505296","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6250843"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-07T15:14:45.387Z","modified":"2019-01-07T15:14:45.397Z","is_collab":false},"15":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"1c854d000cef41898abc281c3f96c4e3","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/1c854d000cef41898abc281c3f96c4e3.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/1c854d000cef41898abc281c3f96c4e3"}},"title":"Diet-dependent gene expression highlights the importance of Cytochrome P450 in detoxification of algal secondary metabolites in a marine isopod.","authors":[{"family":"De Wit","given":"Pierre","initials":"P"},{"family":"Yamada","given":"Keith","initials":"K"},{"family":"Panova","given":"Marina","initials":"M"},{"family":"Andr\u00e9","given":"Carl","initials":"C"},{"family":"Johannesson","given":"Kerstin","initials":"K"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-11-14","journal":{"volume":"8","issn":"2045-2322","issue":"1","pages":"16824","title":"Sci Rep"},"abstract":"Isopods of the genus Idotea have an unusual ability to feed on algae containing high amounts of chemical defense molecules, such as species of the genera Fucus and Ulva.

The latter involve plants of three orders, Fagales, Rosales, and Cucurbitales. To understand the diversity of plant symbiotic adaptation, we compared the nodule transcriptomes of \n            Datisca glomerata (Datiscaceae, Cucurbitales) and Ceanothus thyrsiflorus (Rhamnaceae, Rosales); both species are nodulated by members of the uncultured Frankia clade, cluster II. The analysis focused on various features. In both species, the expression of orthologs of legume Nod factor receptor genes was elevated in nodules compared to roots. Since arginine has been postulated as export form of fixed nitrogen from symbiotic Frankia in nodules of D. glomerata, the question was whether the nitrogen metabolism was similar in nodules of C. thyrsiflorus. Analysis of the expression levels of key genes encoding enzymes involved in arginine metabolism revealed up-regulation of arginine catabolism, but no up-regulation of arginine biosynthesis, in nodules compared to roots of D. glomerata, while arginine degradation was not upregulated in nodules of C. thyrsiflorus. This new information corroborated an arginine-based metabolic exchange between host and microsymbiont for D. glomerata, but not for C. thyrsiflorus. Oxygen protection systems for nitrogenase differ dramatically between both species. Analysis of the antioxidant system suggested that the system in the nodules of D. glomerata leads to greater oxidative stress than the one in the nodules of C. thyrsiflorus, while no differences were found for the defense against nitrosative stress. However, induction of nitrite reductase in nodules of C. thyrsiflorus indicated that here, nitrite produced from nitric oxide had to be detoxified. Additional shared features were identified: genes encoding enzymes involved in thiamine biosynthesis were found to be upregulated in the nodules of both species. Orthologous nodule-specific subtilisin-like proteases that have been linked to the infection process in actinorhizal Fagales, were also upregulated in the nodules of D. glomerata and C. thyrsiflorus. Nodule-specific defensin genes known from actinorhizal Fagales and Cucurbitales, were also found in C. thyrsiflorus. In summary, the results underline the variability of nodule metabolism in different groups of symbiotic plants while pointing at conserved features involved in the infection process.","doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2018.01629","pmid":"30487804","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6246699"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-04T14:04:17.164Z","modified":"2019-01-07T15:14:44.717Z","is_collab":false},"17":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"600002c1545f47b7b6cdf6d664511eb1","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/600002c1545f47b7b6cdf6d664511eb1.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/600002c1545f47b7b6cdf6d664511eb1"}},"title":"Parallel plumage colour evolution and introgressive hybridization in wheatears.","authors":[{"family":"Schweizer","given":"Manuel","initials":"M"},{"family":"Warmuth","given":"Vera","initials":"V"},{"family":"Alaei Kakhki","given":"Niloofar","initials":"N"},{"family":"Aliabadian","given":"Mansour","initials":"M"},{"family":"F\u00f6rschler","given":"Marc","initials":"M"},{"family":"Shirihai","given":"Hadoram","initials":"H"},{"family":"Suh","given":"Alexander","initials":"A"},{"family":"Burri","given":"Reto","initials":"R"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-11-12","journal":{"volume":null,"issn":"1420-9101","issue":null,"title":"J.

Here, we investigated the evolution of discordant phenotypic and genetic divergence in a monophyletic clade of four songbird taxa - pied wheatear (O.\u00a0pleschanka), Cyprus wheatear (O.\u00a0cypriaca), and western and eastern subspecies of black-eared wheatear (O.\u00a0h.\u00a0hispanica and O.\u00a0h.\u00a0melanoleuca). Phenotypically, black back and neck sides distinguish pied and Cyprus wheatears from the white-backed\/necked black-eared wheatears. Meanwhile, mitochondrial variation only distinguishes western black-eared wheatear. In the absence of nuclear genetic data, and given frequent hybridization among eastern black-eared and pied wheatear, it remains unclear whether introgression is responsible for discordance between mitochondrial divergence patterns and phenotypic similarities, or whether plumage coloration evolved in parallel. Multispecies coalescent analyses of about 20\u00a0000 SNPs obtained from RAD data mapped to a draft genome assembly resolve the species tree, provide evidence for the parallel evolution of colour phenotypes and establish western and eastern black-eared wheatears as independent taxa that should be recognized as full species. The presence of the entire admixture spectrum in the Iranian hybrid zone and the detection of footprints of introgression from pied into eastern black-eared wheatear beyond the hybrid zone despite strong geographic structure of ancestry proportions furthermore suggest a potential role for introgression in parallel plumage colour evolution.

Surprisingly, EAE-specific OL lineage populations expressed genes involved in antigen processing and presentation via major histocompatibility complex class I and II (MHC-I and -II), and in immunoprotection, suggesting alternative functions of these cells in a disease context. Importantly, we found that disease-specific oligodendroglia are also present in human MS brains and that a substantial number of genes known to be susceptibility genes for MS, so far mainly associated with immune cells, are expressed in the OL lineage cells. Finally, we demonstrate that OPCs can phagocytose and that MHC-II-expressing OPCs can activate memory and effector CD4-positive T cells. Our results suggest that OLs and OPCs are not passive targets but instead active immunomodulators in MS. The disease-specific OL lineage cells, for which we identify several biomarkers, may represent novel direct targets for immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches in MS.","doi":"10.1038\/s41591-018-0236-y","pmid":"30420755","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Eukaryotic Single Cell Genomics (ESCG)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","Bioinformatics Long-term Support WABI":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"GEO","description":"RNA-seq data","key":"GSE113973"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-11-15T15:59:21.309Z","modified":"2019-01-07T15:13:39.674Z","is_collab":false},"19":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"51df1c5fe3f94631a980b3a69ab8490c","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/51df1c5fe3f94631a980b3a69ab8490c.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/51df1c5fe3f94631a980b3a69ab8490c"}},"title":"Replicative and non-replicative mechanisms in the formation of clustered CNVs are indicated by whole genome characterization.","authors":[{"family":"Nazaryan-Petersen","given":"Lusine","initials":"L"},{"family":"Eisfeldt","given":"Jesper","initials":"J"},{"family":"Pettersson","given":"Maria","initials":"M"},{"family":"Lundin","given":"Johanna","initials":"J"},{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Daniel","initials":"D"},{"family":"Wincent","given":"Josephine","initials":"J"},{"family":"Lieden","given":"Agne","initials":"A"},{"family":"Lovmar","given":"Lovisa","initials":"L"},{"family":"Ottosson","given":"Jesper","initials":"J"},{"family":"Gacic","given":"Jelena","initials":"J"},{"family":"M\u00e4kitie","given":"Outi","initials":"O"},{"family":"Nordgren","given":"Ann","initials":"A"},{"family":"Vezzi","given":"Francesco","initials":"F"},{"family":"Wirta","given":"Valtteri","initials":"V"},{"family":"K\u00e4ller","given":"Max","initials":"M"},{"family":"Hjortsh\u00f8j","given":"Tina Duelund","initials":"TD"},{"family":"Jespersgaard","given":"Cathrine","initials":"C"},{"family":"Houssari","given":"Rayan","initials":"R"},{"family":"Pignata","given":"Laura","initials":"L"},{"family":"Bak","given":"Mads","initials":"M"},{"family":"Tommerup","given":"Niels","initials":"N"},{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Elisabeth Syk","initials":"ES"},{"family":"T\u00fcmer","given":"Zeynep","initials":"Z"},{"family":"Lindstrand","given":"Anna","initials":"A"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-11-00","journal":{"volume":"14","issn":"1553-7404","issue":"11","pages":"e1007780","title":"PLoS Genet."},"abstract":"Clustered copy number variants (CNVs) as detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) are often reported as germline chromothripsis. However, such cases might need further investigations by massive parallel whole genome sequencing (WGS) in order to accurately define the underlying complex rearrangement, predict the occurrence mechanisms and identify additional complexities. Here, we utilized WGS to delineate the rearrangement structure of 21 clustered CNV carriers first investigated by CMA and identified a total of 83 breakpoint junctions (BPJs). The rearrangements were further sub-classified depending on the patterns observed: I) Cases with only deletions (n = 8) often had additional structural rearrangements, such as insertions and inversions typical to chromothripsis; II) cases with only duplications (n = 7) or III) combinations of deletions and duplications (n = 6) demonstrated mostly interspersed duplications and BPJs enriched with microhomology. In two cases the rearrangement mutational signatures indicated both a breakage-fusion-bridge cycle process and haltered formation of a ring chromosome. Finally, we observed two cases with Alu- and LINE-mediated rearrangements as well as two unrelated individuals with seemingly identical clustered CNVs on 2p25.3, possibly a rare European founder rearrangement. In conclusion, through detailed characterization of the derivative chromosomes we show that multiple mechanisms are likely involved in the formation of clustered CNVs and add further evidence for chromoanagenesis mechanisms in both \"simple\" and highly complex chromosomal rearrangements. Finally, WGS characterization adds positional information, important for a correct clinical interpretation and deciphering mechanisms involved in the formation of these rearrangements.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1007780","pmid":"30419018","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"PGENETICS-D-18-01290"},{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6258378"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-04T14:04:10.399Z","modified":"2019-01-07T15:13:36.426Z","is_collab":false},"20":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"ba3bc1c0a7244242b962888f6748f6d2","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/ba3bc1c0a7244242b962888f6748f6d2.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/ba3bc1c0a7244242b962888f6748f6d2"}},"title":"Barcoded solid-phase RNA capture for Spatial Transcriptomics profiling in mammalian tissue sections.","authors":[{"family":"Salm\u00e9n","given":"Fredrik","initials":"F"},{"family":"St\u00e5hl","given":"Patrik L","initials":"PL"},{"family":"Mollbrink","given":"Annelie","initials":"A"},{"family":"Navarro","given":"Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez","initials":"JF"},{"family":"Vickovic","given":"Sanja","initials":"S"},{"family":"Fris\u00e9n","given":"Jonas","initials":"J"},{"family":"Lundeberg","given":"Joakim","initials":"J"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-11-00","journal":{"volume":"13","issn":"1750-2799","issue":"11","pages":"2501-2534","title":"Nat Protoc"},"abstract":"Spatial resolution of gene expression enables gene expression events to be pinpointed to a specific location in biological tissue.

Recent advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have made it possible to obtain unbiased high-throughput gene expression data in bulk. Spatial Transcriptomics combines the benefits of traditional spatially resolved technologies with the massive throughput of RNA-seq. Here, we present a protocol describing how to apply the Spatial Transcriptomics technology to mammalian tissue. This protocol combines histological staining and spatially resolved RNA-seq data from intact tissue sections. Once suitable tissue-specific conditions have been established, library construction and sequencing can be completed in ~5-6 d.

In particular, gene mutations in the transforming growth factor (TGF)\u03b2 superfamily signaling pathways can cause human congenital heart defects, and murine loss of function studies of a central component in this pathway, Smad4, leads to early embryonic lethality. To define the role of SMAD4 at the earliest stages of human cardiogenesis, we generated SMAD4 mutant human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Herein, we show that the loss of SMAD4 has no effect on hESC self-renewal, or neuroectoderm formation, but is essential for the formation of cardiac mesoderm, with a subsequent complete loss of CM formation during human ES cell cardiogenesis. Via transcriptional profiling, we show that SMAD4 mutant cell lines fail to generate cardiac mesodermal precursors, clarifying a role of NODAL\/SMAD4 signaling in cardiac mesodermal precursor formation via enhancing the expression of primitive streak genes. Since SMAD4 relative pathways have been linked to congenital malformations, it will become of interest to determine whether these may due, in part, to defective cell fate decision during cardiac mesodermal precursor formation.

Both ssDNA and ssRNA conferred the endocytic inhibition, it was concentration dependent, and required a certain ssON length.

Deconvolution combined with traditional approaches for dimensional reduction of transcriptome-wide data enabled us to both visualize the transcriptional landscape within the tissue and identify gene expression profiles linked to specific histologic entities. Our unsupervised analysis revealed a complex spatial intratumoral composition of melanoma metastases that was not evident through morphologic annotation. Each biopsy showed distinct gene expression profiles and included examples of the coexistence of multiple melanoma signatures within a single tumor region as well as shared profiles for lymphoid tissue characterized according to their spatial location and gene expression profiles. The lymphoid area in close proximity to the tumor region displayed a specific expression pattern, which may reflect the TME, a key component to fully understanding tumor progression. In conclusion, using the ST technology to generate gene expression profiles reveals a detailed landscape of melanoma metastases.

Taken together, the novel biomarkers identified here may improve ovarian carcinoma subclassification and patient stratification according to histotype and overall survival.","doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.26225","pmid":"30416686","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"26225"},{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6205557"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-04T14:04:15.592Z","modified":"2019-01-07T15:13:42.426Z","is_collab":false},"28":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"d794f36d72b34629b910abcbdfae6a78","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/d794f36d72b34629b910abcbdfae6a78.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/d794f36d72b34629b910abcbdfae6a78"}},"title":"Enhanced validation of antibodies for research applications.","authors":[{"family":"Edfors","given":"Fredrik","initials":"F"},{"family":"Hober","given":"Andreas","initials":"A"},{"family":"Linderb\u00e4ck","given":"Klas","initials":"K"},{"family":"Maddalo","given":"Gianluca","initials":"G"},{"family":"Azimi","given":"Alireza","initials":"A"},{"family":"Sivertsson","given":"\u00c5sa","initials":"\u00c5"},{"family":"Tegel","given":"Hanna","initials":"H"},{"family":"Hober","given":"Sophia","initials":"S"},{"family":"Szigyarto","given":"Cristina Al-Khalili","initials":"CA"},{"family":"Fagerberg","given":"Linn","initials":"L"},{"family":"von Feilitzen","given":"Kalle","initials":"K"},{"family":"Oksvold","given":"Per","initials":"P"},{"family":"Lindskog","given":"Cecilia","initials":"C"},{"family":"Forsstr\u00f6m","given":"Bj\u00f6rn","initials":"B"},{"family":"Uhlen","given":"Mathias","initials":"M"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-10-08","journal":{"volume":"9","issn":"2041-1723","issue":"1","pages":"4130","title":"Nat Commun"},"abstract":"There is a need for standardized validation methods for antibody specificity and selectivity.

Here, we used targeted copy number variant (CNV) screening and identified intragenic exonic duplications, formed through Alu-Alu fusion events, in two individuals with skeletal dysplasia and negative exome sequencing results. First, we detected a homozygous tandem duplication of exon 9 and 10 in IFT81 in a boy with Jeune syndrome, or short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD) (MIM# 208500). Western blot analysis did not detect any wild-type IFT81 protein in fibroblasts from the patient with the IFT81 duplication, but only a shorter isoform of IFT81 that was also present in the normal control samples. Complementary zebrafish studies suggested that loss of full-length IFT81 protein but expression of a shorter form of IFT81 protein affects the phenotype while being compatible with life. Second, a de novo tandem duplication of exons 2 to 5 in MATN3 was identified in a girl with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) type 5 (MIM# 607078). Our data highlights the importance of detection and careful characterization of intragenic duplication CNVs, presenting them as a novel and very rare genetic mechanism in IFT81-related Jeune syndrome and MATN3-related MED.","doi":"10.1002\/humu.23605","pmid":"30080953","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service","Clinical Genomics Stockholm":"Service"},"xrefs":[],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-29T09:07:40.413Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:54:20.746Z","is_collab":false},"30":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"39c6d6654fb7485c9ba727f21f554c4e","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/39c6d6654fb7485c9ba727f21f554c4e.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/39c6d6654fb7485c9ba727f21f554c4e"}},"title":"Partial genomic survival of cave bears in living brown bears.","authors":[{"family":"Barlow","given":"Axel","initials":"A"},{"family":"Cahill","given":"James A","initials":"JA"},{"family":"Hartmann","given":"Stefanie","initials":"S"},{"family":"Theunert","given":"Christoph","initials":"C"},{"family":"Xenikoudakis","given":"Georgios","initials":"G"},{"family":"Fortes","given":"Gloria G","initials":"GG"},{"family":"Paijmans","given":"Johanna L A","initials":"JLA"},{"family":"Rabeder","given":"Gernot","initials":"G"},{"family":"Frischauf","given":"Christine","initials":"C"},{"family":"Grandal-d'Anglade","given":"Aurora","initials":"A"},{"family":"Garc\u00eda-V\u00e1zquez","given":"Ana","initials":"A"},{"family":"Murtskhvaladze","given":"Marine","initials":"M"},{"family":"Saarma","given":"Urmas","initials":"U"},{"family":"Anijalg","given":"Peeter","initials":"P"},{"family":"Skrbin\u0161ek","given":"Toma\u017e","initials":"T"},{"family":"Bertorelle","given":"Giorgio","initials":"G"},{"family":"Gasparian","given":"Boris","initials":"B"},{"family":"Bar-Oz","given":"Guy","initials":"G"},{"family":"Pinhasi","given":"Ron","initials":"R"},{"family":"Slatkin","given":"Montgomery","initials":"M"},{"family":"Dal\u00e9n","given":"Love","initials":"L"},{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Beth","initials":"B"},{"family":"Hofreiter","given":"Michael","initials":"M"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-10-00","journal":{"volume":"2","issn":"2397-334X","issue":"10","pages":"1563-1570","title":"Nat Ecol Evol"},"abstract":"Although many large mammal species went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, their DNA may persist due to past episodes of interspecies admixture.

In contrast, the environmental factors and habitat preferences that drive diversity patterns for micro-organisms in the ground remain elusive, despite the fact that micro-organisms constitute the overwhelming majority of life forms in any given location, in terms of both diversity and abundance. Here we address how the diversity and community turnover of operational taxonomic units (OTU) of organisms in soil and litter respond to soil physicochemical properties; whether OTU diversities and community composition in soil and litter are correlated with each other; and whether they respond in a similar way to soil properties.\n\nWe used recently inferred OTUs from high-throughput metabarcoding of the 16S (prokaryotes) and 18S (eukaryotes) genes to estimate OTU diversity (OTU richness and effective number of OTUs) and community composition for prokaryotes and eukaryotes in soil and litter across four localities in Brazilian Amazonia. All analyses were run separately for prokaryote and eukaryote OTUs, and for each group using both presence-absence and abundance data. Combining these with novel data on soil chemical and physical properties, we identify abiotic correlates of soil and litter organism diversity and community structure using regression, ordination, and variance partitioning analysis.\n\nSoil organic carbon content was the strongest factor explaining OTU diversity (negative correlation) and pH was the strongest factor explaining community turnover for prokaryotes and eukaryotes in both soil and litter. We found significant effects also for other soil variables, including both chemical and physical properties. The correlation between OTU diversity in litter and in soil was non-significant for eukaryotes and weak for prokaryotes. The community compositions of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes were more separated among habitat types (terra-firme, v\u00e1rzea, igap\u00f3 and campina) than between substrates (soil and litter).\n\nIn spite of the limited sampling (four localities, 39 plots), our results provide a broad-scale view of the physical and chemical correlations of soil and litter biodiversity in a longitudinal transect across the world's largest rainforest. Our methods help to understand links between soil properties, OTU diversity patterns, and community composition and turnover. The lack of strong correlation between OTU diversity in litter and in soil suggests independence of diversity drives of these substrates and highlights the importance of including both measures in biodiversity assessments. Massive sequencing of soil and litter samples holds the potential to complement traditional biological inventories in advancing our understanding of the factors affecting tropical diversity.","doi":"10.7717\/peerj.5661","pmid":"30280033","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"5661"},{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6161700"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-31T19:47:36.212Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:54:59.420Z","is_collab":false},"34":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"bd9ce56d91f24b62abce9e7413819c9c","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/bd9ce56d91f24b62abce9e7413819c9c.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/bd9ce56d91f24b62abce9e7413819c9c"}},"title":"SWI\/SNF interacts with cleavage and polyadenylation factors and facilitates pre-mRNA 3' end processing.","authors":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Simei","initials":"S"},{"family":"Jord\u00e1n-Pla","given":"Antonio","initials":"A"},{"family":"Ga\u00f1ez-Zapater","given":"Antoni","initials":"A"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Shruti","initials":"S"},{"family":"Rolicka","given":"Anna","initials":"A"},{"family":"\u00d6stlund Farrants","given":"Ann-Kristin","initials":"AK"},{"family":"Visa","given":"Neus","initials":"N"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-09-19","journal":{"volume":"46","issn":"1362-4962","issue":"16","pages":"8557-8573","title":"Nucleic Acids Res."},"abstract":"SWI\/SNF complexes associate with genes and regulate transcription by altering the chromatin at the promoter.

The connectivity patterns of the three subclasses of type I neurons with inner hair cells and their electrophysiological profiles suggest that they represent the intensity-coding properties of auditory afferents. Moreover, neuron type specification is already established at birth, indicating a neuronal diversification process independent of neuronal activity. Thus, this work provides a transcriptional catalog of neuron types in the cochlea, which serves as a valuable resource for dissecting cell-type-specific functions of dedicated afferents in auditory perception and in hearing disorders.","doi":"10.1038\/s41467-018-06033-3","pmid":"30209249","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Eukaryotic Single Cell Genomics (ESCG)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"10.1038\/s41467-018-06033-3"},{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6135759"},{"db":"GEO","description":"Neuronal heterogeneity and stereotyped connectivity in the auditory afferent system","key":"GSE117055"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-31T13:03:39.950Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:54:18.184Z","is_collab":false},"37":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"d20710fa0ed14236b32b9fd18ef95c95","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/d20710fa0ed14236b32b9fd18ef95c95.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/d20710fa0ed14236b32b9fd18ef95c95"}},"title":"Contribution of allelic imbalance to colorectal cancer.","authors":[{"family":"Palin","given":"Kimmo","initials":"K"},{"family":"Pitk\u00e4nen","given":"Esa","initials":"E"},{"family":"Turunen","given":"Mikko","initials":"M"},{"family":"Sahu","given":"Biswajyoti","initials":"B"},{"family":"Pihlajamaa","given":"P\u00e4ivi","initials":"P"},{"family":"Kivioja","given":"Teemu","initials":"T"},{"family":"Kaasinen","given":"Eevi","initials":"E"},{"family":"V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki","given":"Niko","initials":"N"},{"family":"H\u00e4nninen","given":"Ulrika A","initials":"UA"},{"family":"Cajuso","given":"Tatiana","initials":"T"},{"family":"Aavikko","given":"Mervi","initials":"M"},{"family":"Tuupanen","given":"Sari","initials":"S"},{"family":"Kilpivaara","given":"Outi","initials":"O"},{"family":"van den Berg","given":"Linda","initials":"L"},{"family":"Kondelin","given":"Johanna","initials":"J"},{"family":"Tanskanen","given":"Tomas","initials":"T"},{"family":"Katainen","given":"Riku","initials":"R"},{"family":"Grau","given":"Marta","initials":"M"},{"family":"Rauanheimo","given":"Heli","initials":"H"},{"family":"Plaketti","given":"Roosa-Maria","initials":"RM"},{"family":"Taira","given":"Aurora","initials":"A"},{"family":"Sulo","given":"P\u00e4ivi","initials":"P"},{"family":"Hartonen","given":"Tuomo","initials":"T"},{"family":"Dave","given":"Kashyap","initials":"K"},{"family":"Schmierer","given":"Bernhard","initials":"B"},{"family":"Botla","given":"Sandeep","initials":"S"},{"family":"Sokolova","given":"Maria","initials":"M"},{"family":"V\u00e4h\u00e4rautio","given":"Anna","initials":"A"},{"family":"Gladysz","given":"Kornelia","initials":"K"},{"family":"Ongen","given":"Halit","initials":"H"},{"family":"Dermitzakis","given":"Emmanouil","initials":"E"},{"family":"Bramsen","given":"Jesper Bertram","initials":"JB"},{"family":"\u00d8rntoft","given":"Torben Falck","initials":"TF"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Claus Lindbjerg","initials":"CL"},{"family":"Ristim\u00e4ki","given":"Ari","initials":"A"},{"family":"Lepist\u00f6","given":"Anna","initials":"A"},{"family":"Renkonen-Sinisalo","given":"Laura","initials":"L"},{"family":"Mecklin","given":"Jukka-Pekka","initials":"JP"},{"family":"Taipale","given":"Jussi","initials":"J"},{"family":"Aaltonen","given":"Lauri A","initials":"LA"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-09-10","journal":{"volume":"9","issn":"2041-1723","issue":"1","pages":"3664","title":"Nat Commun"},"abstract":"Point mutations in cancer have been extensively studied but chromosomal gains and losses have been more challenging to interpret due to their unspecific nature.

The disease phenotype varies greatly. Most commonly, OI arises from monoallelic mutations in one of the two genes encoding type I collagen, COL1A1 and COL1A2 and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Here, we describe a consanguineous family with autosomal recessive OI caused by a novel homozygous glycine substitution in COL1A2, NM_000089.3: c.604G>A, p.(Gly202Ser), detected by whole-genome sequencing. The index patient is a 31-year-old Greek woman with severe skeletal fragility. She had mild short stature, low bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and blue sclerae. She had sustained multiple long bone and vertebral fractures since childhood and had been treated with bisphosphonates for several years. She also had an affected sister with similar clinical manifestations. Interestingly, the parents and one sister, all carriers of the COL1A2 glycine mutation, did not have manifestations of OI. In summary, we report on autosomal recessive OI caused by a homozygous glycine-to-serine substitution in COL1A2, leading to severe skeletal fragility. The mutation carriers lacked OI manifestations. This family further expands the complex genetic spectrum of OI and underscores the importance of genetic evaluation for correct genetic counselling.","doi":"10.1007\/s00223-018-0414-4","pmid":"29572562","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Bioinformatics Long-term Support WABI":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-26T11:53:38.555Z","modified":"2018-10-31T19:48:04.185Z","is_collab":false},"41":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"5d1f0d08b17940f5b307cb09e4276c5d","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/5d1f0d08b17940f5b307cb09e4276c5d.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/5d1f0d08b17940f5b307cb09e4276c5d"}},"title":"Phylogenetic relationships of rollers (Coraciidae) based on complete mitochondrial genomes and fifteen nuclear genes.","authors":[{"family":"Johansson","given":"Ulf S","initials":"US"},{"family":"Irestedt","given":"Martin","initials":"M"},{"family":"Qu","given":"Yanhua","initials":"Y"},{"family":"Ericson","given":"Per G P","initials":"PGP"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-09-00","journal":{"volume":"126","issn":"1095-9513","issue":null,"pages":"17-22","title":"Mol.

In this study we examine the phylogenetic relationships of all species currently recognized in the family, including two taxa whose taxonomic status is currently contested. By using shotgun sequencing on degraded DNA from museum study skins we have been able to recover complete mitochondrial genomes as well as 15 nuclear genes for in total 16 taxa. The gene sequences were analyzed both concatenated in a maximum likelihood framework as well in a species tree approach using MP-EST. The different analytical approaches yield similar, highly supported trees and support the current division of the rollers into two genera, Coracias and Eurystomus. The only conflict relates to the placement of the Blue-bellied Roller (C. cyanogaster), where the mitochondrial, and the concatenated nuclear and mitochondrial data set, place this taxon as sister to the other Coracias species, whereas nuclear data and the species tree analysis place it as the sister taxon of C. naevia and C. spatulatus. All analyses place the Eurasian roller (C. garrulus) with the two African species, Abyssinian Roller (C. abyssinica) and Liliac-breasted Roller (C. caudatus), and place this clade as the sister group to the Asian Coracias rollers. In addition, our results support a sister group relationship between the morphologically rather dissimilar Purple Roller (C. naevia) and Racquet-tailed Roller (C. spatulatus) and also support the division of Eurystomus in an African and an Asian clade. However, within the Asian clade the Azure Roller (E. azureus) from Halmahera appears to be nested within the Dollarbird (E. orientalis), indicating that that this taxon is a morphological divergent, but a rather recent offshoot, of the widespread Dollarbird. Similarly, the Purple-winged Roller (C. temminickii) from Sulawesi group together with C. benghalensis affinis from Southeast Asia and these two in turn comprises the sister group to C. benghalensis benghalensis from India and western Asia.","doi":"10.1016\/j.ympev.2018.03.030","pmid":"29631051","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"S1055-7903(17)30880-1"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-31T19:47:39.236Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:50:38.344Z","is_collab":false},"42":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"7859a4a903104d5da707d0e722968e8d","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/7859a4a903104d5da707d0e722968e8d.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/7859a4a903104d5da707d0e722968e8d"}},"title":"The molecular genetic basis of herbivory between butterflies and their host plants.","authors":[{"family":"Nallu","given":"Sumitha","initials":"S"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Jason A","initials":"JA"},{"family":"Don","given":"Kristine","initials":"K"},{"family":"Sahagun","given":"Carlos","initials":"C"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wei","initials":"W"},{"family":"Meslin","given":"Camille","initials":"C"},{"family":"Snell-Rood","given":"Emilie","initials":"E"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Nathan L","initials":"NL"},{"family":"Morehouse","given":"Nathan I","initials":"NI"},{"family":"Bergelson","given":"Joy","initials":"J"},{"family":"Wheat","given":"Christopher W","initials":"CW"},{"family":"Kronforst","given":"Marcus R","initials":"MR"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-09-00","journal":{"volume":"2","issn":"2397-334X","issue":"9","pages":"1418-1427","title":"Nat Ecol Evol"},"abstract":"Interactions between herbivorous insects and their host plants are a central component of terrestrial food webs and a critical topic in agriculture, where a substantial fraction of potential crop yield is lost annually to pests. Important insights into plant-insect interactions have come from research on specific plant defences and insect detoxification mechanisms. Yet, much remains unknown about the molecular mechanisms that mediate plant-insect interactions. Here we use multiple genome-wide approaches to map the molecular basis of herbivory from both plant and insect perspectives, focusing on butterflies and their larval host plants. Parallel genome-wide association studies in the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae, and its host plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, pinpointed a small number of butterfly and plant genes that influenced herbivory. These genes, along with much of the genome, were regulated in a dynamic way over the time course of the feeding interaction. Comparative analyses, including diverse butterfly\/plant systems, showed a variety of genome-wide responses to herbivory, as well as a core set of highly conserved genes in butterflies as well as their host plants. These results greatly expand our understanding of the genomic causes and evolutionary consequences of ecological interactions across two of nature's most diverse taxa, butterflies and flowering plants.","doi":"10.1038\/s41559-018-0629-9","pmid":"30076351","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"10.1038\/s41559-018-0629-9"},{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6149523"},{"db":"mid","key":"NIHMS979338"},{"db":"SRA","description":"https:\/\/trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Traces\/sra\/?study=SRP134094","key":"SRP134094"},{"db":"Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database","description":"Arabidopsis thaliana, transcriptome shotgun assembly","key":"GGJX00000000"},{"db":"Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database","description":"Medicago sativa, transcriptome shotgun assembly","key":"GGKA00000000"},{"db":"Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database","description":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/nuccore\/GGJQ00000000","key":"GGJQ00000000"},{"db":"Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database","description":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/nuccore\/GGJO00000000","key":"GGJO00000000"},{"db":"Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database","description":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/nuccore\/GGJY00000000","key":"GGJY00000000"},{"db":"Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database","description":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/nuccore\/GGJZ00000000","key":"GGJZ00000000"},{"db":"Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database","description":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/nuccore\/GGKB00000000","key":"GGKB00000000"},{"db":"Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly Sequence Database","description":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/nuccore\/GGKC00000000","key":"GGKC00000000"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-31T19:46:18.340Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:53:16.587Z","is_collab":false},"43":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"a97fb528f0834255b1e9c8103f8ff2bc","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/a97fb528f0834255b1e9c8103f8ff2bc.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/a97fb528f0834255b1e9c8103f8ff2bc"}},"title":"Genome Sequence Resource for the Oomycete Taro Pathogen Phytophthora colocasiae.","authors":[{"family":"Vetukuri","given":"Ramesh R","initials":"RR"},{"family":"Kushwaha","given":"Sandeep K","initials":"SK"},{"family":"Sen","given":"Diya","initials":"D"},{"family":"Whisson","given":"Stephen C","initials":"SC"},{"family":"Lamour","given":"Kurt H","initials":"KH"},{"family":"Grenville-Briggs","given":"Laura J","initials":"LJ"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-09-00","journal":{"volume":"31","issn":"0894-0282","issue":"9","pages":"903-905","title":"Mol.

We examined the landscape genomic structure of an edge-tolerant forest-dependent bird species, the Striped Tit-Babbler Mixornis gularis, in the heavily urbanized island of Singapore to determine if two centuries of fragmentation have led to signs of isolation and loss of population-genetic diversity in different parts of the island. We obtained a high-quality complete reference genome with 78x coverage. Using almost 4000 SNPs from double-digest RAD-Sequencing across 46 individuals, we found that the population has likely experienced a recent contraction in effective population size and presently exhibits low population genetic diversity. Using empirical and simulation-based landscape genomic analyses, we also found that the subtle population genetic structure observed in the Striped Tit-Babbler population in Singapore is likely driven by isolation by distance resulting from limited dispersal. Our results demonstrate that population genetic impoverishment and subdivision can accumulate at relatively rapid rates in edge-tolerant bird species such as the Striped Tit-Babbler as a result of fragmentation, and that subtle spatial genetic structure can be detected over fine spatial and temporal scales using relatively few multilocus genomic SNPs.","doi":"10.1038\/s41598-018-31074-5","pmid":"30143731","labels":{"NGI Stockholm (Genomics Applications)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Stockholm (Genomics Production)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"10.1038\/s41598-018-31074-5"},{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6109123"},{"db":"BioProject","description":"Complete genome and RAD-seq study of Mixornis gularis","key":"PRJNA392017"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-31T19:47:38.570Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:56:01.230Z","is_collab":false},"46":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"2d325f1ceb9d4e138fce98bfee37557c","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/2d325f1ceb9d4e138fce98bfee37557c.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/2d325f1ceb9d4e138fce98bfee37557c"}},"title":"Stereotypic Immune System Development in Newborn Children.","authors":[{"family":"Olin","given":"Axel","initials":"A"},{"family":"Henckel","given":"Ewa","initials":"E"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yang","initials":"Y"},{"family":"Lakshmikanth","given":"Tadepally","initials":"T"},{"family":"Pou","given":"Christian","initials":"C"},{"family":"Mikes","given":"Jaromir","initials":"J"},{"family":"Gustafsson","given":"Anna","initials":"A"},{"family":"Bernhardsson","given":"Anna Karin","initials":"AK"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Cheng","initials":"C"},{"family":"Bohlin","given":"Kajsa","initials":"K"},{"family":"Brodin","given":"Petter","initials":"P"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-08-23","journal":{"volume":"174","issn":"1097-4172","issue":"5","pages":"1277-1292.e14","title":"Cell"},"abstract":"Epidemiological data suggest that early life exposures are key determinants of immune-mediated disease later in life.

Here, we performed longitudinal analyses in 100 newborn children, sampled up to 4 times during their first 3\u00a0months of life. From 100\u00a0\u03bcL of blood, we analyze the development of 58 immune cell populations by mass cytometry and 267 plasma proteins by immunoassays, uncovering drastic changes not predictable from cord blood measurements but following a stereotypic pattern.

It is unclear whether there is a correlation between these waves and different oligodendrocyte (OL) states at adult stages. Here, we present bulk and single-cell transcriptomics resources providing insights on how transitions between these states occur. We found that post-natal OPCs from brain and spinal cord present similar transcriptional signatures. Moreover, post-natal OPC progeny of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells present electrophysiological and transcriptional profiles similar to OPCs derived from subsequent specification waves, indicating that Pdgfra+ pre-OPCs rewire their transcriptional network during development. Single-cell RNA-seq and lineage tracing indicates that a subset of E13.5 Pdgfra+ cells originates cells of the pericyte lineage. Thus, our results indicate that embryonic Pdgfra+ cells in the CNS give rise to distinct post-natal cell lineages, including OPCs with convergent transcriptional profiles in different CNS

We analyzed the association of body-fat distribution, assessed by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index, with 228,985 predicted coding and splice site variants available on exome arrays in up to 344,369 individuals from five major ancestries (discovery) and 132,177 European-ancestry individuals (validation). We identified 15 common (minor allele frequency, MAF \u22655%) and nine low-frequency or rare (MAF <5%) coding novel variants. Pathway\/gene set enrichment analyses identified lipid particle, adiponectin, abnormal white adipose tissue physiology and bone development and morphology as important contributors to fat distribution, while cross-trait associations highlight cardiometabolic traits. In functional follow-up analyses, specifically in Drosophila RNAi-knockdowns, we observed a significant increase in the total body triglyceride levels for two genes (DNAH10 and PLXND1). We implicate novel genes in fat distribution, stressing the importance of interrogating low-frequency and protein-coding variants.","doi":"10.1038\/s41588-018-0334-2","pmid":"30778226","labels":{"NGI

Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (r\n            g\u2009=\u20090.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD.","doi":"10.1038\/s41588-018-0311-9","pmid":"30617256","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"10.1038\/s41588-018-0311-9"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-03-13T09:21:28.969Z","modified":"2019-03-13T09:21:28.980Z","is_collab":false},"103":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"b06725ea3ccc41b7a6cfe3ab0c4e3c0a","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/b06725ea3ccc41b7a6cfe3ab0c4e3c0a.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/b06725ea3ccc41b7a6cfe3ab0c4e3c0a"}},"title":"A genome-wide association study identifies new loci for factor VII and implicates factor VII in ischemic stroke etiology.","authors":[{"family":"de Vries","given":"Paul S","initials":"PS"},{"family":"Sabater-Lleal","given":"Maria","initials":"M"},{"family":"Huffman","given":"Jennifer E","initials":"JE"},{"family":"Marten","given":"Jonathan","initials":"J"},{"family":"Song","given":"Ci","initials":"C"},{"family":"Pankratz","given":"Nathan","initials":"N"},{"family":"Bartz","given":"Traci M","initials":"TM"},{"family":"de Haan","given":"Hugoline G","initials":"HG"},{"family":"Delgado","given":"Graciela E","initials":"GE"},{"family":"Eicher","given":"John D","initials":"JD"},{"family":"Martinez-Perez","given":"Angel","initials":"A"},{"family":"Ward-Caviness","given":"Cavin K","initials":"CK"},{"family":"Brody","given":"Jennifer A","initials":"JA"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ming-Huei","initials":"MH"},{"family":"de Maat","given":"Moniek P M","initials":"MPM"},{"family":"Fr\u00e5nberg","given":"Mattias","initials":"M"},{"family":"Gill","given":"Dipender","initials":"D"},{"family":"Kleber","given":"Marcus E","initials":"ME"},{"family":"Rivadeneira","given":"Fernando","initials":"F"},{"family":"Soria","given":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel","initials":"JM"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Weihong","initials":"W"},{"family":"Tofler","given":"Geoffrey H","initials":"GH"},{"family":"Uitterlinden","given":"Andr\u00e9 G","initials":"AG"},{"family":"van Hylckama Vlieg","given":"Astrid","initials":"A"},{"family":"Seshadri","given":"Sudha","initials":"S"},{"family":"Boerwinkle","given":"Eric","initials":"E"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Neil M","initials":"NM"},{"family":"Giese","given":"Anne-Katrin","initials":"AK"},{"family":"Ikram","given":"M Kamran","initials":"MK"},{"family":"Kittner","given":"Steven J","initials":"SJ"},{"family":"McKnight","given":"Barbara","initials":"B"},{"family":"Psaty","given":"Bruce M","initials":"BM"},{"family":"Reiner","given":"Alex P","initials":"AP"},{"family":"Sargurupremraj","given":"Muralidharan","initials":"M"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Kent D","initials":"KD"},{"family":"INVENT Consortium","given":"","initials":""},{"family":"MEGASTROKE Consortium of the International Stroke Genetics Consortium","given":"","initials":""},{"family":"Fornage","given":"Myriam","initials":"M"},{"family":"Hamsten","given":"Anders","initials":"A"},{"family":"M\u00e4rz","given":"Winfried","initials":"W"},{"family":"Rosendaal","given":"Frits R","initials":"FR"},{"family":"Souto","given":"Juan Carlos","initials":"JC"},{"family":"Dehghan","given":"Abbas","initials":"A"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Andrew D","initials":"AD"},{"family":"Morrison","given":"Alanna C","initials":"AC"},{"family":"O'Donnell","given":"Christopher J","initials":"CJ"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Nicholas L","initials":"NL"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2019-02-28","journal":{"volume":"133","issn":"1528-0020","issue":"9","pages":"967-977","title":"Blood"},"abstract":"Factor VII (FVII) is an important component of the coagulation cascade.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 9 genome-wide association studies of plasma FVII levels (7 FVII activity and 2 FVII antigen) among 27\u2009495 participants of European and African ancestry. Each study performed ancestry-specific association analyses. Inverse variance weighted meta-analysis was performed within each ancestry group and then combined for a \n            trans-ancestry meta-analysis. Our primary analysis included the 7 studies that measured FVII activity, and a secondary analysis included all 9 studies. We provided functional genomic validation for newly identified significant loci by silencing candidate genes in a human liver cell line (HuH7) using small-interfering RNA and then measuring F7 messenger RNA and FVII protein expression. Lastly, we used meta-analysis results to perform Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of FVII activity on coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke (IS), and venous thromboembolism. We identified 2 novel (REEP3 and JAZF1-AS1) and 6 known loci associated with FVII activity, explaining 19.0% of the phenotypic variance. Adding FVII antigen data to the meta-analysis did not result in the discovery of further loci. Silencing REEP3 in HuH7 cells upregulated FVII, whereas silencing JAZF1 downregulated FVII. Mendelian randomization analyses suggest that FVII activity has a positive causal effect on the risk of IS. Variants at REEP3 and JAZF1 contribute to FVII activity by regulating F7 expression levels. FVII activity appears to contribute to the etiology of IS in the general population.","doi":"10.1182\/blood-2018-05-849240","pmid":"30642921","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"blood-2018-05-849240"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-03-13T09:21:27.986Z","modified":"2019-03-13T09:21:27.998Z","is_collab":false},"104":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"79c087299ab448418fad91a86e9a6d2e","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/79c087299ab448418fad91a86e9a6d2e.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/79c087299ab448418fad91a86e9a6d2e"}},"title":"Genetics and epigenetics in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.","authors":[{"family":"Imgenberg-Kreuz","given":"Juliana","initials":"J"},{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"Astrid","initials":"A"},{"family":"Sivils","given":"Kathy","initials":"K"},{"family":"Nordmark","given":"Gunnel","initials":"G"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2019-02-15","journal":{"volume":null,"issn":"1462-0332","issue":null,"title":"Rheumatology (Oxford)"},"abstract":"Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) is considered to be a multifactorial disease, where underlying genetic predisposition, epigenetic mechanisms and environmental factors contribute to disease development. In the last 5 years, the first genome-wide association studies in pSS have been completed. The strongest signal of association lies within the HLA genes, whereas the non-HLA genes IRF5 and STAT4 show consistent associations in multiple ethnicities but with a smaller effect size. The majority of the genetic risk variants are found at intergenic regions and their functional impact has in most cases not been elucidated. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs play a role in the pathogenesis of pSS by their modulating effects on gene expression and may constitute a dynamic link between the genome and phenotypic manifestations. This article reviews the hitherto published genetic studies and our current understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in pSS.","doi":"10.1093\/rheumatology\/key330","pmid":"30770922","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"5321203"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-03-13T09:21:22.219Z","modified":"2019-03-13T09:21:22.236Z","is_collab":false},"105":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"cc74f4cd8d9b4314b59b768ea493f52f","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/cc74f4cd8d9b4314b59b768ea493f52f.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/cc74f4cd8d9b4314b59b768ea493f52f"}},"title":"Association of the coronary artery disease risk gene GUCY1A3 with ischaemic events after coronary intervention.","authors":[{"family":"Kessler","given":"Thorsten","initials":"T"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Bernhard","initials":"B"},{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Niclas","initials":"N"},{"family":"Kofink","given":"Daniel","initials":"D"},{"family":"Mahmoodi","given":"Bakhtawar K","initials":"BK"},{"family":"Rai","given":"Himanshu","initials":"H"},{"family":"Tragante","given":"Vinicius","initials":"V"},{"family":"\u00c5kerblom","given":"Axel","initials":"A"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Richard C","initials":"RC"},{"family":"Bernlochner","given":"Isabell","initials":"I"},{"family":"Bopp","given":"Roman","initials":"R"},{"family":"James","given":"Stefan","initials":"S"},{"family":"Katus","given":"Hugo A","initials":"HA"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Katharina","initials":"K"},{"family":"Munz","given":"Matthias","initials":"M"},{"family":"Nordio","given":"Francesco","initials":"F"},{"family":"O'Donoghue","given":"Michelle L","initials":"ML"},{"family":"Sager","given":"Hendrik B","initials":"HB"},{"family":"Sibbing","given":"Dirk","initials":"D"},{"family":"Solakov","given":"Linda","initials":"L"},{"family":"Storey","given":"Robert F","initials":"RF"},{"family":"Wobst","given":"Jana","initials":"J"},{"family":"Asselbergs","given":"Folkert W","initials":"FW"},{"family":"Byrne","given":"Robert A","initials":"RA"},{"family":"Erdmann","given":"Jeanette","initials":"J"},{"family":"Koenig","given":"Wolfgang","initials":"W"},{"family":"Laugwitz","given":"Karl-Ludwig","initials":"KL"},{"family":"Ten Berg","given":"Jurrien M","initials":"JM"},{"family":"Wallentin","given":"Lars","initials":"L"},{"family":"Kastrati","given":"Adnan","initials":"A"},{"family":"Schunkert","given":"Heribert","initials":"H"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2019-02-14","journal":{"volume":null,"issn":"1755-3245","issue":null,"title":"Cardiovasc.

The risk of ischaemic events including stent thrombosis varies with the efficacy of aspirin to inhibit platelet reactivity. This study sought to investigate whether homozygous GUCY1A3 (rs7692387) risk allele carriers display higher on-aspirin platelet reactivity and risk of ischaemic events early after coronary intervention.\n\nThe association of GUCY1A3 genotype and on-aspirin platelet reactivity was analysed in the genetics substudy of the ISAR-ASPI registry (n\u2009=\u20091678) using impedance aggregometry. The clinical outcome cardiovascular death or stent thrombosis within 30\u2009days after stenting was investigated in a meta-analysis of substudies of the ISAR-ASPI registry, the PLATO trial (n\u2009=\u20093236), and the Utrecht Coronary Biobank (n\u2009=\u20091003) comprising a total 5917 patients. Homozygous GUCY1A3 risk allele carriers (GG) displayed increased on-aspirin platelet reactivity compared with non-risk allele (AA\/AG) carriers [150 (interquartile range 91-209) vs. 134 (85-194) AU\u22c5min, P\u2009<\u20090.01]. More homozygous risk allele carriers, compared with non-risk allele carriers, were assigned to the high-risk group for ischaemic events (>203\u2009AU\u22c5min; 29.5 vs. 24.2%, P\u2009=\u20090.02). Homozygous risk allele carriers were also at higher risk for cardiovascular death or stent thrombosis (hazard ratio 1.70, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.68; P\u2009=\u20090.02). Bleeding risk was not altered.\n\nWe conclude that homozygous GUCY1A3 risk allele carriers are at increased risk of cardiovascular death or stent thrombosis within 30\u2009days after coronary stenting, likely due to higher on-aspirin platelet reactivity. Whether GUCY1A3 genotype helps to tailor antiplatelet treatment remains to be investigated.","doi":"10.1093\/cvr\/cvz015","pmid":"30768153","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"5320311"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-03-13T09:21:23.117Z","modified":"2019-03-13T09:21:23.138Z","is_collab":false},"106":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"68743e5b18c84dccb5ae3d1e44e83dc3","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/68743e5b18c84dccb5ae3d1e44e83dc3.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/68743e5b18c84dccb5ae3d1e44e83dc3"}},"title":"Introgression of resistance to Rhopalosiphum padi L. from wild barley into cultivated barley facilitated by doubled haploid and molecular marker techniques.","authors":[{"family":"\u00c5hman","given":"Inger","initials":"I"},{"family":"Bengtsson","given":"Ther\u00e9se","initials":"T"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2019-02-02","journal":{"volume":null,"issn":"1432-2242","issue":null,"title":"Theor.

Bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) is a pest and a virus vector in barley to which there are no bred-resistant cultivars. The present study describes how resistance from Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum has been introgressed in cultivated barley via five successive crosses with the same cultivar Lina (BC) and in parallel with other more modern barley cultivars. Most of the selections for resistance are based on measurements of individual aphid growth in the laboratory. This very slow phenotyping method has been complemented by molecular marker evaluation and application in part of the breeding material. Doubled haploid production in each generation has been crucial for more precise selection of lines with the quantitatively expressed resistance. A field trial of selected \"BC\n            3\"-generation lines essentially confirmed the laboratory results, so did genotyping of the whole pedigree of parents and selected \"BC2\" and \"BC4\" offspring lines.

Such an adjustment may reduce the power to identify genetic signals having an association with both lean mass and fat mass.\n\nTo determine the impact of different fat mass adjustments on genetic architecture of LM and identify additional LM loci.\n\nWe performed genome-wide association analyses for whole-body LM (20 cohorts of European ancestry with n\u00a0=\u00a038,292) measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) or bioelectrical impedance analysis, adjusted for sex, age, age2, and height with or without fat mass adjustments (Model 1 no fat adjustment; Model 2 adjustment for fat mass as a percentage of body mass; Model 3 adjustment for fat mass in kilograms).\n\nSeven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in separate loci, including one novel LM locus (TNRC6B), were successfully replicated in an additional 47,227 individuals from 29 cohorts. Based on the strengths of the associations in Model 1 vs Model 3, we divided the LM loci into those with an effect on both lean mass and fat mass in the same direction and refer to those as \"sumo wrestler\" loci (FTO and MC4R). In contrast, loci with an impact specifically on LM were termed \"body builder\" loci (VCAN and ADAMTSL3). Using existing available genome-wide association study databases, LM increasing alleles of SNPs in sumo wrestler loci were associated with an adverse metabolic profile, whereas LM increasing alleles of SNPs in \"body builder\" loci were associated with metabolic protection.\n\nIn conclusion, we identified one novel LM locus (TNRC6B). Our results suggest that a genetically determined increase in lean mass might exert either harmful or protective effects on metabolic traits, depending on its relation to fat mass.","doi":"10.1093\/ajcn\/nqy272","pmid":"30721968","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology

In a combined sample of over 1 million individuals, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of general risk tolerance, adventurousness, and risky behaviors in the driving, drinking, smoking, and sexual domains. Across all GWAS, we identified hundreds of associated loci, including 99 loci associated with general risk tolerance. We report evidence of substantial shared genetic influences across risk tolerance and the risky behaviors: 46 of the 99 general risk tolerance loci contain a lead SNP for at least one of our other GWAS, and general risk tolerance is genetically correlated ([Formula: see text]\u2009~\u20090.25 to 0.50) with a range of risky behaviors. Bioinformatics analyses imply that genes near SNPs associated with general risk tolerance are highly expressed in brain tissues and point to a role for glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. We found no evidence of enrichment for genes previously hypothesized to relate to risk tolerance.","doi":"10.1038\/s41588-018-0309-3","pmid":"30643258","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"10.1038\/s41588-018-0309-3"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-03-13T09:21:27.036Z","modified":"2019-03-13T09:21:27.046Z","is_collab":false},"109":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"5dcc907f38414467976927bd7619e5b6","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/5dcc907f38414467976927bd7619e5b6.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/5dcc907f38414467976927bd7619e5b6"}},"title":"Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy is associated with genes related to immunity and neuronal survival.","authors":[{"family":"Hallberg","given":"P\u00e4r","initials":"P"},{"family":"Smedje","given":"Hans","initials":"H"},{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Niclas","initials":"N"},{"family":"Kohnke","given":"Hugo","initials":"H"},{"family":"Daniilidou","given":"Makrina","initials":"M"},{"family":"\u00d6hman","given":"Inger","initials":"I"},{"family":"Yue","given":"Qun-Ying","initials":"QY"},{"family":"Cavalli","given":"Marco","initials":"M"},{"family":"Wadelius","given":"Claes","initials":"C"},{"family":"Magnusson","given":"Patrik K E","initials":"PKE"},{"family":"Landtblom","given":"Anne-Marie","initials":"AM"},{"family":"Wadelius","given":"Mia","initials":"M"},{"family":"Swedegene","given":"","initials":""}],"type":"journal article","published":"2019-01-30","journal":{"volume":null,"issn":"2352-3964","issue":null,"title":"EBioMedicine"},"abstract":"The incidence of narcolepsy rose sharply after the swine influenza A (H1N1) vaccination campaign with Pandemrix. Narcolepsy is an immune-related disorder with excessive daytime sleepiness. The most frequent form is strongly associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02, but only a minority of carriers develop narcolepsy. We aimed to identify genetic markers that predispose to Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy.\n\nWe tested for genome-wide and candidate gene associations in 42 narcolepsy cases and 4981 controls. Genotyping was performed on Illumina arrays, HLA alleles were imputed using SNP2HLA, and single nucleotide polymorphisms were imputed using the haplotype reference consortium panel. The genome-wide significance threshold was p\u202f<\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\n                -8, and the nominal threshold was p\u202f<\u202f0.05. Results were replicated in 32 cases and 7125 controls. Chromatin data was used for functional annotation.\n\nCarrying HLA-DQB1*06:02 was significantly associated with narcolepsy, odds ratio (OR) 39.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.3, 137], p\u202f=\u202f7.9\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\n                -9. After adjustment for HLA, GDNF-AS1 (rs62360233) was significantly associated, OR\u202f=\u202f8.7 [95% CI 4.2, 17.5], p\u202f=\u202f2.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-9, and this was replicated, OR\u202f=\u202f3.4 [95% CI 1.2-9.6], p\u202f=\u202f0.022. Functional analysis revealed variants in high LD with rs62360233 that might explain the detected association. The candidate immune-gene locus TRAJ (rs1154155) was nominally associated in both the discovery and replication cohorts, meta-analysis OR\u202f=\u202f2.0 [95% CI 1.4, 2.8], p\u202f=\u202f0.0002.\n\nWe found a novel association between Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy and the non-coding RNA gene GDNF-AS1, which has been shown to regulate expression of the essential neurotrophic factor GDNF. Changes in regulation of GDNF have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This finding may increase the understanding of disease mechanisms underlying narcolepsy. Associations between Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy and immune-related genes were replicated.","doi":"10.1016\/j.ebiom.2019.01.041","pmid":"30711515","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"S2352-3964(19)30048-9"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-03-13T09:21:25.995Z","modified":"2019-03-13T09:21:26.007Z","is_collab":false},"110":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"88f530d9a18040d2a24f397f4025ca13","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/88f530d9a18040d2a24f397f4025ca13.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/88f530d9a18040d2a24f397f4025ca13"}},"title":"Genetic risk for neuroticism predicts emotional health depending on childhood adversity","authors":[{"family":"Lehto","given":"Kelli","initials":"K"},{"family":"Karlsson","given":"Ida","initials":"I"},{"family":"Lundholm","given":"Cecilia","initials":"C"},{"family":"Pedersen","given":"Nancy L","initials":"NL"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2019-01-00","journal":{"volume":"49","issn":"0033-2917","issue":"02","pages":"260-267","title":"Psychol.

for substance abuse among adolescents. Recently, epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation have emerged as potential mechanisms that could mediate this relationship. The authors conducted a genome-wide methylation analysis to investigate whether differentially methylated regions are associated with psychosocial stress in an adolescent population.\n\nA methylome-wide analysis of differentially methylated regions was used to examine a sample of 1,287 14-year-old adolescents (50.7% of them female) from the European IMAGEN study. The Illumina 450k array was used to assess DNA methylation, pyrosequencing was used for technical replication, and linear regression analyses were used to identify associations with psychosocial stress and substance use (alcohol and tobacco). Findings were replicated by pyrosequencing a test sample of 413 participants from the IMAGEN study.\n\nHypermethylation in the sterile alpha motif\/pointed domain containing the ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) gene locus was associated with a greater number of stressful life events in an allele-dependent way. Among individuals with the minor G-allele, SPDEF methylation moderated the association between psychosocial stress and substance abuse. SPDEF methylation interacted with lifetime stress in gray matter volume in the right cuneus, which in turn was associated with the frequency of alcohol and tobacco use. SPDEF was involved in the regulation of trans-genes linked to substance use.\n\nTaken together, the study findings describe a novel epigenetic mechanism that helps explain how psychosocial stress exposure influences adolescent substance abuse.","doi":"10.1176\/appi.ajp.2018.17121360","pmid":"30525907","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology

The conflict it generates is expected to be an important motor for evolutionary change and innovation. In this study, we investigated the genomic consequences of two large multi-gene meiotic drive elements, Sk-2 and Sk-3, found in the filamentous ascomycete Neurospora intermedia. Using long-read sequencing, we generated the first complete and well-annotated genome assemblies of large, highly diverged, non-recombining regions associated with meiotic drive elements. Phylogenetic analysis shows that, even though Sk-2 and Sk-3 are located in the same chromosomal region, they do not form sister clades, suggesting independent origins or at least a long evolutionary separation. We conclude that they have in a convergent manner accumulated similar patterns of tandem inversions and dense repeat clusters, presumably in response to similar needs to create linkage between genes causing drive and resistance.","doi":"10.1038\/s41467-018-06562-x","pmid":"30315196","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"BioProject","description":"Genomics of spore killing in Neurospora intermedia.","key":"PRJNA486257"},{"db":"figshare","description":"Follow link to download","key":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.6084\/m9.figshare.c.4202669.v1"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-22T10:10:47.479Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:55:50.911Z","is_collab":false},"123":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"2fbe656ef4894b12b0e51cf2485d8978","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/2fbe656ef4894b12b0e51cf2485d8978.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/2fbe656ef4894b12b0e51cf2485d8978"}},"title":"Significant loss of mitochondrial diversity within the last century due to extinction of peripheral populations in eastern gorillas","authors":[{"family":"van der Valk","given":"Tom","initials":"T"},{"family":"Sandoval-Castellanos","given":"Edson","initials":"E"},{"family":"Caillaud","given":"Damien","initials":"D"},{"family":"Ngobobo","given":"Urbain","initials":"U"},{"family":"Binyinyi","given":"Escobar","initials":"E"},{"family":"Nishuli","given":"Radar","initials":"R"},{"family":"Stoinski","given":"Tara","initials":"T"},{"family":"Gilissen","given":"Emmanuel","initials":"E"},{"family":"Sonet","given":"Gontran","initials":"G"},{"family":"Semal","given":"Patrick","initials":"P"},{"family":"Kalthoff","given":"Daniela C","initials":"DC"},{"family":"Dal\u00e9n","given":"Love","initials":"L"},{"family":"Guschanski","given":"Katerina","initials":"K"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-12-00","journal":{"volume":"8","issn":"2045-2322","issue":"1","pages":null,"title":"Sci Rep"},"abstract":null,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-018-24497-7","pmid":"29695730","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"GENBANK","description":"This just first sequence, there are multiple sequences from MH177628 -

are common. The aim of this study was to explore whether genetic variation might be linked to acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR).\n\nOne hundred and nineteen women undergoing adjuvant RT for breast cancer were included. The symptoms of itching, burning and irritation were self-reported twice using the visual analogue scale. Assessments used the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system for acute RT skin reaction (RTOG scale). Blood-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed. Thirty SNPs of well-defined functional genes were investigated.\n\nAll women were assessed with ARSR. After RT, the women self-reported itching (n=97), burning (n=64) and irritation (n=96). Two SNPs in X-Ray Repair Cross Complementing 2 gene (XRCC2) rs2040639 and interferon gamma (IFNG) rs2069705 genes were found to be associated with ARSR.\n\nAn association between two SNPs and ARSR was found. The possibility of using these SNPs as prognostic biomarkers for ARSR as tools to improve the care of patients needs further investigation.","doi":"10.21873\/anticanres.13047","pmid":"30504388","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology

One example of this is the gymnosperm sister clade to angiosperm TM3-like MADS-box genes, which at least in the conifer lineage has expanded in number of genes. We have previously identified a member of this sub-clade, the conifer gene \n            DEFICIENS AGAMOUS LIKE 19 (DAL19), as being specifically upregulated in cone-setting shoots. Here, we show through Sanger sequencing of mRNA-derived cDNA and mapping to assembled conifer genomic sequences that DAL19 produces six mature mRNA splice variants in Picea abies. These splice variants use alternate first and last exons, while their four central exons constitute a core region present in all six transcripts. Thus, they are likely to be transcript isoforms. Quantitative Real-Time PCR revealed that two mutually exclusive first DAL19 exons are differentially expressed across meristems that will form either male or female cones, or vegetative shoots. Furthermore, mRNA in situ hybridization revealed that two mutually exclusive last DAL19 exons were expressed in a cell-specific pattern within bud meristems. Based on these findings in DAL19, we developed a sensitive approach to transcript isoform assembly from short-read sequencing of mRNA. We applied this method to 42 putative MADS-box core regions in P. abies, from which we assembled 1084 putative transcripts. We manually curated these transcripts to arrive at 933 assembled transcript isoforms of 38 putative MADS-box genes. 152 of these isoforms, which we assign to 28 putative MADS-box genes, were differentially expressed across eight female, male, and vegetative buds. We further provide evidence of the expression of 16 out of the 38 putative MADS-box genes by mapping PacBio Iso-Seq circular consensus reads derived from pooled sample sequencing to assembled transcripts. In summary, our analyses reveal the use of mutually exclusive exons of MADS-box gene isoforms during early bud development in P. abies, and we find that the large number of identified MADS-box transcripts in P. abies results not only from expansion of the gene family through gene duplication events but also from the generation of numerous splice variants.","doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2018.01625","pmid":"30483285","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service","Bioinformatics Support and

The vast majority of the known endosymbiotic interactions involve bacteria that have invaded eukaryotic host cells. However, methanogenic archaea have been found to thrive in anaerobic, hydrogenosome-containing protists and it was suggested that this symbiosis is based on the transfer of hydrogen. Here, we used culture-independent genomics approaches to sequence the genomes of two distantly related methanogenic endosymbionts that have been acquired in two independent events by closely related anaerobic ciliate hosts Nyctotherus ovalis and Metopus contortus, respectively. The sequences obtained were then validated as originating from the ciliate endosymbionts by in situ probing experiments. Comparative analyses of these genomes and their closest free-living counterparts reveal that the genomes of both endosymbionts are in an early stage of adaptation towards endosymbiosis as evidenced by the large number of genes undergoing pseudogenization. For instance, the observed loss of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis in both endosymbiont genomes indicates that the endosymbionts rely on their hosts for obtaining several essential nutrients. Furthermore, the endosymbionts appear to have gained significant amounts of genes of potentially secreted proteins, providing targets for future studies aiming to elucidate possible mechanisms underpinning host-interactions. Altogether, our results provide the first genomic insights into prokaryotic endosymbioses from the archaeal domain of life.","doi":"10.1038\/s41396-018-0207-9","pmid":"29991760","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Service","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"BioProject","description":"Draft genomes of Methanobrevibacter sp.

However, recent studies have suggested that GRCh38 may be incomplete and give a suboptimal representation of specific population groups. Here, we performed a de novo assembly of two Swedish genomes that revealed over 10 Mb of sequences absent from the human GRCh38 reference in each individual. Around 6 Mb of these novel sequences (NS) are shared with a Chinese personal genome. The NS are highly repetitive, have an elevated GC-content, and are primarily located in centromeric or telomeric regions. Up to 1 Mb of NS can be assigned to chromosome Y, and large segments are also missing from GRCh38 at chromosomes 14, 17, and 21. Inclusion of NS into the GRCh38 reference radically improves the alignment and variant calling from short-read whole-genome sequencing data at several genomic loci. A re-analysis of a Swedish population-scale sequencing project yields > 75,000 putative novel single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and removes > 10,000 false positive SNV calls per individual, some of which are located in protein coding regions. Our results highlight that the GRCh38 reference is not yet complete and demonstrate that personal genome assemblies from local populations can improve the analysis of short-read whole-genome sequencing data.","doi":"10.3390\/genes9100486","pmid":"30304863","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology Platform)":"Collaborative","Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","Bioinformatics

currently known. It is activated in response to DNA damage and this activation leads to proliferation arrest and cell death. The abundance and activity of p53 are tightly controlled and reductions in p53's activity can contribute to the development of cancer. Here, we show that Fam83F increases p53 protein levels by protein stabilisation. Fam83F interacts with p53 and decreases its ubiquitination and degradation. Fam83F is induced in response to DNA damage and its overexpression also increases p53 activity in cell culture experiments and in zebrafish embryos. Downregulation of Fam83F decreases transcription of p53 target genes in response to DNA damage and increases cell proliferation, identifying Fam83F as an important regulator of the DNA damage response. Overexpression of Fam83F also enhances migration of cells harbouring mutant p53 demonstrating that it can also activate mutant forms of p53.","doi":"10.1038\/s41418-019-0281-1","pmid":"30692643","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"10.1038\/s41418-019-0281-1"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-02-08T05:36:28.043Z","modified":"2019-02-08T05:36:28.047Z","is_collab":false},"152":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"f88e75a833ca462491c554c649de707a","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/f88e75a833ca462491c554c649de707a.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/f88e75a833ca462491c554c649de707a"}},"title":"The Versatility of SMRT Sequencing.","authors":[{"family":"Hestand","given":"Matthew S","initials":"MS"},{"family":"Ameur","given":"Adam","initials":"A"}],"type":"editorial","published":"2019-01-04","journal":{"volume":"10","issn":"2073-4425","issue":"1","title":"Genes"},"abstract":"The adoption of single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing [...].","doi":"10.3390\/genes10010024","pmid":"30621217","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Collaborative"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"genes10010024"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-10T09:09:50.737Z","modified":"2019-01-10T09:09:50.747Z","is_collab":true},"153":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"1d77882e40ac481f9e4450cf6cd117a0","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/1d77882e40ac481f9e4450cf6cd117a0.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/1d77882e40ac481f9e4450cf6cd117a0"}},"title":"Single-Molecule Sequencing: Towards Clinical Applications.","authors":[{"family":"Ameur","given":"Adam","initials":"A"},{"family":"Kloosterman","given":"Wigard P","initials":"WP"},{"family":"Hestand","given":"Matthew S","initials":"MS"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2019-01-01","journal":{"volume":"37","issn":"1879-3096","issue":"1","pages":"72-85","title":"Trends Biotechnol."},"abstract":"In the past several years, single-molecule sequencing platforms, such as those by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, have become available to researchers and are currently being tested for clinical applications.

Fresh-frozen ICC tumors (n=49) were classified into high and low HPV titer cases using real-time PCR-based HPV genotyping. The mutation spectra were studied using the AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel and the expression profiles using total RNA-sequencing, and the results validated using the AmpliSeq Transcriptome assay. HPV DNA genotyping and RNA sequencing showed that 16.6% of ICC tumors contained very low levels of HPV DNA and HPV transcripts. Tumors with low HPV levels had more mutations with a high allele frequency and fewer mutations with low allele frequency relative to tumors with high HPV titer. A number of genes showed significant expression differences between HPV titer groups, including genes with somatic mutations. Gene ontology and pathway analyses implicated the enrichment of genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle control and extracellular matrix in tumors with low HPV titer. The results indicate that in low titer tumors, HPV act as trigger of cancer development while somatic mutations are clonally selected and become drivers of the tumor development process. In contrast, in tumors with high HPV titer the expression of HPV oncoproteins play a major role in tumor development and the many low frequency somatic mutations represent passengers. This putative subdivision of invasive cervical tumors may explain the higher radiosensitivity of ICC tumors with high HPV titer and thereby have consequences for clinical management.","doi":"10.1093\/carcin\/bgy183","pmid":"30596972","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Collaborative"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"5266715"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2019-01-10T09:09:22.921Z","modified":"2019-01-10T09:09:22.931Z","is_collab":true},"156":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"b8213f26e804494f83921bf4a0a1bb8f","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/b8213f26e804494f83921bf4a0a1bb8f.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/b8213f26e804494f83921bf4a0a1bb8f"}},"title":"A multigene typing system for human adenoviruses reveals a new genotype in a collection of Swedish clinical isolates.","authors":[{"family":"Kaj\u00e1n","given":"Gy\u0151z\u0151 L\u00e1szl\u00f3","initials":"GL"},{"family":"Lipiec","given":"Agnieszka","initials":"A"},{"family":"Bartha","given":"D\u00e1niel","initials":"D"},{"family":"Allard","given":"Annika","initials":"A"},{"family":"Arnberg","given":"Niklas","initials":"N"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-12-14","journal":{"volume":"13","issn":"1932-6203","issue":"12","pages":"e0209038","title":"PLoS ONE"},"abstract":"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are common pathogens that can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and ocular infections. They are divided into seven species containing 85 genotypes. Straightforward typing systems might help epidemiological investigations. As homologous recombination frequently shapes the evolution of HAdVs, information on a single gene is seldom sufficient to allow accurate and precise typing, and complete genome-based methods are recommended. Even so, complete genome analyses are not always easy to perform for practical reasons, and in such cases a multigene system can provide considerably more information about the strain under investigation than single-gene-based methods. Here we present a rapid, generic, multigene typing system for HAdVs based on three main deterministic regions of these viruses. Three PCR systems were used to amplify the genes encoding the DNA polymerase, the penton base hypervariable Arg-Gly-Asp-containing loop, and the hexon loop 1 (hypervariable region 1-6). Using this system, we typed 281 clinical isolates, detected members of six out of seven HAdV species (Human mastadenovirus A-F), and could also detect not only divergent strains of established types but also a new recombinant strain with a previously unpublished combination of adenovirus genomes. This strain was accepted by the Human Adenovirus Working Group as a novel genotype: HAdV-86. Seven strains that could not be typed with sufficient accuracy were also investigated using a PCR based on part of the fiber gene. By analysis of corresponding sequences of the 86 known HAdV genotypes, we determined that the proposed typing system should be able to distinguish all non-recombinant types, and with additional fiber information, all known HAdV genotypes.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0209038","pmid":"30550551","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"PONE-D-18-20669"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-12-19T15:02:02.325Z","modified":"2018-12-19T15:02:02.342Z","is_collab":false},"157":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"0dac09f9afc94864b22ba2a94624bf04","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/0dac09f9afc94864b22ba2a94624bf04.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/0dac09f9afc94864b22ba2a94624bf04"}},"title":"Genetic characterization of a novel picorna-like virus in Culex spp. mosquitoes from Mozambique","authors":[{"family":"Cholleti","given":"Harindranath","initials":"H"},{"family":"Hayer","given":"Juliette","initials":"J"},{"family":"Fafetine","given":"Jose","initials":"J"},{"family":"Berg","given":"Mikael","initials":"M"},{"family":"Blomstr\u00f6m","given":"Anne Lie","initials":"AL"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-12-00","journal":{"volume":"15","issn":"1743-422X","issue":"1","pages":null,"title":"Virol J"},"abstract":null,"doi":"10.1186\/s12985-018-0981-z","pmid":"29669586","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"GENBANK","description":"Culex picorna-like virus 1 isolate MZ2014-PV polyprotein gene, complete cds","key":"MG833031"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-06-25T14:09:38.331Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:47:19.316Z","is_collab":false},"159":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"41310d917aa84a619687fedd84e19192","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/41310d917aa84a619687fedd84e19192.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/41310d917aa84a619687fedd84e19192"}},"title":"Epigenetics and early domestication: differences in hypothalamic DNA methylation between red junglefowl divergently selected for high or low fear of humans","authors":[{"family":"B\u00e9lteky","given":"Johan","initials":"J"},{"family":"Agnvall","given":"Beatrix","initials":"B"},{"family":"Bektic","given":"Lejla","initials":"L"},{"family":"H\u00f6glund","given":"Andrey","initials":"A"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Per","initials":"P"},{"family":"Guerrero-Bosagna","given":"Carlos","initials":"C"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-12-00","journal":{"volume":"50","issn":"1297-9686","issue":"1","pages":null,"title":"Genet.

Such alterations are caused by genomic variations, yet the prevalence of modified traits is higher than expected if they were caused only by classical genetics and mutations. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be important in driving domesticated phenotypes such as behavior traits. Gene expression can be modulated epigenetically by mechanisms such as DNA methylation, resulting in modifications that are not only variable and susceptible to environmental stimuli, but also sometimes transgenerationally stable. To study such mechanisms in early domestication, we used as model two selected lines of red junglefowl (ancestors of modern chickens) that were bred for either high or low fear of humans over five generations, and investigated differences in hypothalamic DNA methylation between the two populations.\n\nTwenty-two 1-kb windows were differentially methylated between the two selected lines at p\u2009<\u20090.05 after false discovery rate correction. The annotated functions of the genes within these windows indicated epigenetic regulation of metabolic and signaling pathways, which agrees with the changes in gene expression that were previously reported for the same tissue and animals.\n\nOur results show that selection for an important domestication-related behavioral trait such as tameness can cause divergent epigenetic patterns within only five generations, and that these changes could have an important role in chicken domestication.","doi":"10.1186\/s12711-018-0384-z","pmid":"29609558","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"EBI","description":"https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/arrayexpress\/experiments\/E-MTAB-6407\/","key":"E-MTAB-6407"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-15T09:59:03.510Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:47:01.298Z","is_collab":false},"160":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"41cfd0759db84dcea10e76c92a8204b1","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/41cfd0759db84dcea10e76c92a8204b1.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/41cfd0759db84dcea10e76c92a8204b1"}},"title":"Sharing of photobionts in sympatric populations of Thamnolia and Cetraria lichens: evidence from high-throughput sequencing","authors":[{"family":"Onu\u021b-Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","given":"Ioana","initials":"I"},{"family":"Benjamin","given":"Mitchell","initials":"M"},{"family":"Scofield","given":"Douglas G","initials":"DG"},{"family":"Hei\u00f0marsson","given":"Starri","initials":"S"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Martin G I","initials":"MGI"},{"family":"Lindstr\u00f6m","given":"Eva S","initials":"ES"},{"family":"Johannesson","given":"Hanna","initials":"H"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-12-00","journal":{"volume":"8","issn":"2045-2322","issue":"1","pages":null,"title":"Sci Rep"},"abstract":null,"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-018-22470-y","pmid":"29535321","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"ENA","description":"https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ena\/data\/view\/ERR2307093","key":"ERR2307093"},{"db":"ENA","description":"https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ena\/data\/view\/ERR2307094","key":"ERR2307094"},{"db":"ENA","description":"https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ena\/data\/view\/ERR2307095","key":"ERR2307095"},{"db":"ENA","description":"https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ena\/data\/view\/ERR2307096","key":"ERR2307096"},{"db":"ENA","description":"https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ena\/data\/view\/ERR2307097","key":"ERR2307097"},{"db":"ENA","description":"https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ena\/data\/view\/ERR2307098","key":"ERR2307098"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":"This just first sequence, there are multiple sequences from MG372066 -

ZEB1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Triple-negative human breast cancers express high ZEB1 mRNA levels and exhibit features of EMT. In the human triple-negative breast cancer cell model Hs578T, ZEB1 associates with almost 2,000 genes, representing many cellular functions, including cell polarity regulation (DLG2 and FAT3). By introducing a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated 30\u2009bp deletion into the ZEB1 second exon, we observed reduced migratory and anchorage-independent growth capacity of these tumor cells. Transcriptomic analysis of control and ZEB1 knockout cells, revealed 1,372 differentially expressed genes. The TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 and the teneurin transmembrane protein 2 genes showed increased expression upon loss of ZEB1, possibly mediating pro-tumorigenic actions of ZEB1. This work provides a resource for regulators of cancer progression that function under the transcriptional control of ZEB1. The data confirm that removing a single EMT transcription factor, such as ZEB1, is not sufficient for reverting the triple-negative mesenchymal breast cancer cells into more differentiated, epithelial-like clones, but can reduce tumorigenic potential, suggesting that not all pro-tumorigenic actions of ZEB1 are linked to the EMT.","doi":"10.1002\/jcp.26634","pmid":"29744893","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pmc","key":"PMC6055758"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-11-08T13:21:30.482Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:52:55.429Z","is_collab":false},"165":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"fcc3450672a04634ba6dc161936d5eb1","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/fcc3450672a04634ba6dc161936d5eb1.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/fcc3450672a04634ba6dc161936d5eb1"}},"title":"Rapid Increase in Carriage Rates of Enterobacteriaceae Producing Extended-Spectrum \u03b2-Lactamases in Healthy Preschool Children, Sweden","authors":[{"family":"Kaarme","given":"Johan","initials":"J"},{"family":"Riedel","given":"Hilde","initials":"H"},{"family":"Schaal","given":"Wesley","initials":"W"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Hong","initials":"H"},{"family":"Nev\u00e9us","given":"Tryggve","initials":"T"},{"family":"Melhus","given":"\u00c5sa","initials":"\u00c5"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-10-00","journal":{"volume":"24","issn":"1080-6040","issue":"10","pages":"1874-1881","title":"Emerg.

Vestibulopathy is in most cases associated with migraine, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease, hereditary ataxias, or sensorineural hearing loss. We identified two brothers and their first cousin affected by hearing loss and episodic vertigo. The brothers were homozygous STRC nonsense variant [c.4027\u2009C\u2009>\u2009T, p.(Q1343*)], whereas their first cousin was compound heterozygous for the STRC nonsense variant and a 97\u2009kb deletion spanning the entire STRC gene. Clinical investigations confirmed pathological vestibular responses in addition to a characteristic DFNB16 hearing loss. The STRC gene encodes Stereocilin in the cochlea and in the vestibular organ where it ensheathes the kinocilium of the otolithic membranes. Stereocilin is associated with the gel overlaying the vestibular kinocilia, suggesting a role for the protein in sensing balance and spatial orientation. Our findings support such a function for Stereocilin in the vestibular organ and expand the phenotype associated with DFNB16.","doi":"10.1038\/s41431-018-0256-6","pmid":"30250054","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"pii","key":"10.1038\/s41431-018-0256-6"}],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-11-08T13:16:49.023Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:49:00.240Z","is_collab":false},"168":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"f989e24dc1864d62a1e0808ea11f31ca","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/f989e24dc1864d62a1e0808ea11f31ca.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/f989e24dc1864d62a1e0808ea11f31ca"}},"title":"Introducing ribosomal tandem repeat barcoding for fungi","authors":[{"family":"Wurzbacher","given":"Christian","initials":"C"},{"family":"Larsson","given":"Ellen","initials":"E"},{"family":"Bengtsson-Palme","given":"Johan","initials":"J"},{"family":"Van den Wyngaert","given":"Silke","initials":"S"},{"family":"Svantesson","given":"Sten","initials":"S"},{"family":"Kristiansson","given":"Erik","initials":"E"},{"family":"Kagami","given":"Maiko","initials":"M"},{"family":"Nilsson","given":"R Henrik","initials":"RH"}],"type":"posted-content","published":"2018-09-21","journal":{"volume":null,"issn":null,"issue":null,"pages":null,"title":"Mol Ecol Resour."},"abstract":"Sequence comparison and analysis of the various ribosomal genetic markers are the dominant molecular methods for identification and description of fungi. However, new environmental fungal lineages known only from DNA data reveal significant gaps in our sampling of the fungal kingdom in terms of both taxonomy and marker coverage in the reference sequence databases. To facilitate the integration of reference data from all of the ribosomal markers, we present three sets of general primers that allow for amplification of the complete ribosomal operon from the ribosomal tandem repeats. The primers cover all ribosomal markers: ETS, SSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, LSU and IGS. We coupled these primers successfully with third-generation sequencing (PacBio and Nanopore sequencing) to showcase our approach on authentic fungal herbarium specimens (Basidiomycota), aquatic chytrids (Chytridiomycota) and a poorly understood lineage of early diverging fungi (Nephridiophagidae). In particular, we were able to generate high-quality reference data with Nanopore sequencing in a high-throughput manner, showing that the generation of reference data can be achieved on a regular desktop computer without the involvement of any large-scale sequencing facility. The quality of the Nanopore generated sequences was 99.85%, which is comparable with the 99.78% accuracy described for Sanger sequencing. With this work, we hope to stimulate the generation of a new comprehensive standard of ribosomal reference data with the ultimate aim to close the huge gaps in our reference datasets.","doi":"10.1111\/1755-0998.12944","pmid":"30240145","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[{"db":"ENA","description":"https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ena\/data\/view\/PRJEB26696","key":"PRJEB26696"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":null,"key":"MH356537"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":null,"key":"MH356538"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":null,"key":"MH356539"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":null,"key":"MH356540"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":null,"key":"MH356541"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":null,"key":"MH356542"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":null,"key":"MH356543"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":null,"key":"MH356544"},{"db":"GENBANK","description":null,"key":"MH356545"}],"notes":"","qc":null,"created":"2018-06-25T14:29:38.213Z","modified":"2019-03-08T12:54:12.834Z","is_collab":false},"169":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"008395179b04487691752ddf94a86ee4","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/008395179b04487691752ddf94a86ee4.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/008395179b04487691752ddf94a86ee4"}},"title":"A New Species of the \u03b3-Proteobacterium Francisella, F. adeliensis Sp.

Ubiquitous in its geographical distribution, M. marinum is known to occupy diverse fish as hosts. However, information about its genomic diversity is limited. Here, we provide the genome sequences for 15 M. marinum strains isolated from infected humans and fish. Comparative genomic analysis of these and four available genomes of the M. marinum strains M, E11, MB2 and Europe reveal high genomic diversity among the strains, leading to the conclusion that M. marinum should be divided into two different clusters, the \"M\"- and the \"Aronson\"-type. We suggest that these two clusters should be considered to represent two M. marinum subspecies. Our data also show that the M. marinum pan-genome for both groups is open and expanding and we provide data showing high number of mutational hotspots in M. marinum relative to other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This high genomic diversity might be related to the ability of M. marinum to occupy different ecological niches.","doi":"10.1038\/s41598-018-30152-y","pmid":"30104693","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ

Whether this reflects principally disparate patterns of Darwinian evolution in different tumor regions has remained unexplored1-5. We mapped the prevalence of genetically distinct clones over 250 regions in 54 childhood cancers. This showed that primary tumors can simultaneously follow up to four evolutionary trajectories over different anatomic areas. The most common pattern consists of subclones with very few mutations confined to a single tumor region. The second most common is a stable coexistence, over vast areas, of clones characterized by changes in chromosome numbers. This is contrasted by a third, less frequent, pattern where a clone with driver mutations or structural chromosome rearrangements emerges through a clonal sweep to dominate an anatomical region. The fourth and rarest pattern is the local emergence of a myriad of clones with TP53 inactivation. Death from disease was limited to tumors exhibiting the two last, most dynamic patterns.","doi":"10.1038\/s41588-018-0131-y","pmid":"29867221","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[],"notes":"","qc":null,"created":"2018-06-25T14:16:47.744Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:51:01.504Z","is_collab":false},"180":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"a32bd58adce24f79864f0d36307dba83","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/a32bd58adce24f79864f0d36307dba83.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/a32bd58adce24f79864f0d36307dba83"}},"title":"Deciphering the genome and secondary metabolome of the plant pathogen Fusarium culmorum","authors":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Ruth","initials":"R"},{"family":"Durling","given":"Mikael B","initials":"MB"},{"family":"de\u00a0Jager","given":"Victor","initials":"V"},{"family":"Menezes","given":"Riya C","initials":"RC"},{"family":"Nordkvist","given":"Erik","initials":"E"},{"family":"Svato\u0161","given":"Ale\u0161","initials":"A"},{"family":"Dubey","given":"Mukesh","initials":"M"},{"family":"Lauterbach","given":"Lukas","initials":"L"},{"family":"Dickschat","given":"Jeroen S","initials":"JS"},{"family":"Karlsson","given":"Magnus","initials":"M"},{"family":"Garbeva","given":"Paolina","initials":"P"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-06-01","journal":{"volume":"94","issn":"1574-6941","issue":"6","pages":null,"title":"FEMS Microbiol.

The mechanisms of the decreased fertility are not fully understood. In this study, we perform transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing of testes from zebrafish with previously reported lowered fertility due to exposure to low concentrations of EE2 during development. Fish were exposed to 1.2 and 1.6\u202fng\/L (measured concentration; nominal concentrations 3 and 10\u202fng\/L) of EE2 from fertilization to 80\u202fdays of age, followed by 82\u202fdays of remediation in clean water. RNA sequencing analysis revealed 249 and 16 genes to be differentially expressed after exposure to 1.2 and 1.6\u202fng\/L, respectively; a larger inter-sample variation was noted in the latter. Expression of 11 genes were altered by both exposures and in the same direction. The coding sequences most affected could be categorized to the putative functions cell signalling, proteolysis, protein metabolic transport and lipid metabolic process. Several homeobox transcription factors involved in development and differentiation showed increased expression in response to EE2 and differential expression of genes related to cell death, differentiation and proliferation was observed. In addition, several genes related to steroid synthesis, testis development and function were differentially expressed. A number of genes associated with spermatogenesis in zebrafish and\/or mouse were also found to be differentially expressed. Further, differences in non-coding sequences were observed, among them several differentially expressed miRNA that might contribute to testis gene regulation at post-transcriptional level. This study has generated insights of changes in gene expression that accompany fertility alterations in zebrafish males that persist after developmental exposure to environmental relevant concentrations of EE2 that persist followed by clean water to adulthood. Hopefully, this will generate hypotheses to test in search for mechanistic explanations.","doi":"10.1016\/j.ygcen.2018.03.011","pmid":"29526718","labels":{"Bioinformatics Support and Infrastructure":"Collaborative","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-06-25T14:08:54.942Z","modified":"2019-01-15T08:11:48.392Z","is_collab":false},"183":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"b070a10c20bd41d4b5742788089cb438","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/b070a10c20bd41d4b5742788089cb438.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/b070a10c20bd41d4b5742788089cb438"}},"title":"A novel ECEL1\n mutation expands the phenotype of distal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita type 5D to include pretibial vertical skin creases","authors":[{"family":"Stattin","given":"Eva Lena","initials":"EL"},{"family":"Johansson","given":"Josefin","initials":"J"},{"family":"Gudmundsson","given":"Sanna","initials":"S"},{"family":"Ameur","given":"Adam","initials":"A"},{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Staffan","initials":"S"},{"family":"Bondeson","given":"Marie Louise","initials":"ML"},{"family":"Wilbe","given":"Maria","initials":"M"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-06-00","journal":{"volume":"176","issn":"1552-4825","issue":"6","pages":"1405-1410","title":"Am J Med Genet"},"abstract":null,"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.a.38691","pmid":"29663639","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-06-25T14:15:11.070Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:55:37.981Z","is_collab":false},"184":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"0ad937af7fdc4e6688de71885bda822f","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/0ad937af7fdc4e6688de71885bda822f.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/0ad937af7fdc4e6688de71885bda822f"}},"title":"Soil microclimate changes affect soil fungal communities in a Mediterranean pine forest","authors":[{"family":"Casta\u00f1o","given":"Carles","initials":"C"},{"family":"Lindahl","given":"Bj\u00f6rn D","initials":"BD"},{"family":"Alday","given":"Josu G","initials":"JG"},{"family":"Hagenbo","given":"Andreas","initials":"A"},{"family":"Mart\u00ednez de Arag\u00f3n","given":"Juan","initials":"J"},{"family":"Parlad\u00e9","given":"Javier","initials":"J"},{"family":"Pera","given":"Joan","initials":"J"},{"family":"Bonet","given":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","initials":"JA"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-05-14","journal":{"volume":null,"issn":"0028-646X","issue":null,"pages":null,"title":"New Phytol"},"abstract":null,"doi":"10.1111\/nph.15205","pmid":"29757469","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[],"notes":"","qc":null,"created":"2018-06-25T13:59:51.598Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:47:06.413Z","is_collab":false},"185":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"3500d5de886449048814de1ef449a274","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/3500d5de886449048814de1ef449a274.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/3500d5de886449048814de1ef449a274"}},"title":"Molecular barcoding of viral vectors enables mapping and optimization of mRNAtrans-splicing","authors":[{"family":"Davidsson","given":"Marcus","initials":"M"},{"family":"D\u00edaz-Fern\u00e1ndez","given":"Paula","initials":"P"},{"family":"Torroba","given":"Marcos","initials":"M"},{"family":"Schwich","given":"Oliver D","initials":"OD"},{"family":"Aldrin-Kirk","given":"Patrick","initials":"P"},{"family":"Quintino","given":"Luis","initials":"L"},{"family":"Heuer","given":"Andreas","initials":"A"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Gang","initials":"G"},{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Cecilia","initials":"C"},{"family":"Bj\u00f6rklund","given":"Tomas","initials":"T"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-05-00","journal":{"volume":"24","issn":"1469-9001","issue":"5","pages":"673-687","title":"RNA"},"abstract":"Genome editing has proven to be highly potent in the generation of functional gene knockouts in dividing cells. In the CNS however, efficient technologies to repair sequences are yet to materialize. Reprogramming on the mRNA level is an attractive alternative as it provides means to perform in situ editing of coding sequences without nuclease dependency. Furthermore, de novo sequences can be inserted without the requirement of homologous recombination. Such reprogramming would enable efficient editing in quiescent cells (e.g., neurons) with an attractive safety profile for translational therapies. In this study, we applied a novel molecular-barcoded screening assay to investigate RNA \n                trans-splicing in mammalian neurons. Through three alternative screening systems in cell culture and in vivo, we demonstrate that factors determining trans-splicing are reproducible regardless of the screening system. With this screening, we have located the most permissive trans-splicing sequences targeting an intron in the Synapsin I gene. Using viral vectors, we were able to splice full-length fluorophores into the mRNA while retaining very low off-target expression. Furthermore, this approach also showed evidence of functionality in the mouse striatum. However, in its current form, the trans-splicing events are stochastic and the overall activity lower than would be required for therapies targeting loss-of-function mutations. Nevertheless, the herein described barcode-based screening assay provides a unique possibility to screen and map large libraries in single animals or cell assays with very high precision.","doi":"10.1261\/rna.063925.117","pmid":"29386333","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-02-09T10:23:25.926Z","modified":"2018-12-10T12:40:22.667Z","is_collab":false},"186":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"4d8cc303c0d544f3b22c70a8591dffd8","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/4d8cc303c0d544f3b22c70a8591dffd8.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/4d8cc303c0d544f3b22c70a8591dffd8"}},"title":"Combined BET bromodomain and CDK2 inhibition in MYC-driven medulloblastoma","authors":[{"family":"Bolin","given":"Sara","initials":"S"},{"family":"Borgenvik","given":"Anna","initials":"A"},{"family":"Persson","given":"Camilla U","initials":"CU"},{"family":"Sundstr\u00f6m","given":"Anders","initials":"A"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Jun","initials":"J"},{"family":"Bradner","given":"James E","initials":"JE"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"William A","initials":"WA"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Yoon Jae","initials":"YJ"},{"family":"Weishaupt","given":"Holger","initials":"H"},{"family":"Swartling","given":"Fredrik J","initials":"FJ"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-05-00","journal":{"volume":"37","issn":"1476-5594","issue":"21","pages":"2850-2862","title":"Oncogene"},"abstract":null,"doi":"10.1038\/s41388-018-0135-1","pmid":"29511348","labels":{"Bioinformatics Compute and Storage":"Service","NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-10-15T09:57:41.272Z","modified":"2018-12-19T12:46:27.668Z","is_collab":false},"187":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"b4bb7eb3567348daa17ff4d5c3656cdc","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/b4bb7eb3567348daa17ff4d5c3656cdc.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/b4bb7eb3567348daa17ff4d5c3656cdc"}},"title":"Increasing sorghum yields by seed treatment with an aqueous extract of the plant  Eclipta alba  may involve a dual mechanism of hydropriming and suppression of fungal pathogens","authors":[{"family":"Zida","given":"P E","initials":"PE"},{"family":"N\u00e9ya","given":"B J","initials":"BJ"},{"family":"Stokholm","given":"M S","initials":"MS"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"S M","initials":"SM"},{"family":"Soalla","given":"W R","initials":"WR"},{"family":"S\u00e9r\u00e9m\u00e9","given":"P","initials":"P"},{"family":"Lund","given":"O S","initials":"OS"}],"type":"journal-article","published":"2018-05-00","journal":{"volume":"107","issn":"0261-2194","issue":null,"pages":"48-55","title":"Crop Protection"},"abstract":null,"doi":"10.1016\/j.cropro.2018.01.001","pmid":null,"labels":{"NGI Uppsala (Uppsala Genome Center)":"Service"},"xrefs":[],"notes":null,"qc":null,"created":"2018-06-25T13:58:16.718Z","modified":"2018-06-25T14:23:06.877Z","is_collab":false},"188":{"entity":"publication","iuid":"13196c56bb9843da951bac3edff3233f","links":{"self":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/13196c56bb9843da951bac3edff3233f.json"},"display":{"href":"https:\/\/publications.scilifelab.se\/publication\/13196c56bb9843da951bac3edff3233f"}},"title":"Repeated evolution of self-compatibility for reproductive assurance.","authors":[{"family":"Nieuwenhuis","given":"Bart P S","initials":"BPS"},{"family":"Tusso","given":"Sergio","initials":"S"},{"family":"Bjerling","given":"Pernilla","initials":"P"},{"family":"St\u00e5ngberg","given":"Josefine","initials":"J"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Jochen B W","initials":"JBW"},{"family":"Immler","given":"Simone","initials":"S"}],"type":"journal article","published":"2018-04-24","journal":{"volume":"9","issn":"2041-1723","issue":"1","pages":"1639","title":"Nat Commun"},"abstract":"Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes requires the fusion of two compatible gametes of opposite sexes or mating types.

Analogous to multiple independent transitions between switchers and non-switchers in natural populations mediated by structural genomic changes, novel switching genotypes readily evolved under selection in the experimental populations. Detailed fitness measurements accompanied by computer simulations show the benefits and costs of switching during sexual and asexual reproduction, governing the occurrence of both strategies in nature.

We also measured soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, and community composition of neighbouring plants and nonAM root-associated fungi. AM fungal communities were already highly dissimilar among neighbouring plants (c.\u00a030\u00a0cm apart), albeit with a high variation in the degree of similarity at this small spatial scale. AM fungal communities were increasingly, and more consistently, dissimilar at larger spatial scales. Spatial structure and environmental drivers explained a similar percentage of the variation, from 7% to 25%. A large fraction of the variation remained unexplained, which may be a result of unmeasured environmental variables, species interactions and stochastic processes. We conclude that AM fungal communities are highly variable among nearby plants.

limits. Limitations mostly arise due to the difficulties in assembly or alignment to genomic regions of high sequence divergence and high repeat content, which are typical characteristics for loci under strong long-term balancing selection. Studying genetic diversity at such loci therefore remains challenging. Here, we investigate the feasibility and error rates associated with targeted long-read sequencing of a locus under balancing selection. For this purpose, we generated bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing the Brassicaceae ","doi":"10.1534\/g3.117.300467","pmid":"29476024","labels":{"NGI Uppsala (SNP&SEQ Technology
